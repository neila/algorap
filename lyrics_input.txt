Yo, this been going for a minute
Cooped up in the dentist office, flowing for the tenants
I been doing some stupid shit like going to work
When I could do some lucrative shit like writing a verse
But it's okay, we gon' make it someday
Whether it's 2028 or Sunday
Do these shows for people that, they've never heard of me
And they fuck with me but then they see me
When they try to cop some sneaks
At Foot Locker, working every damn day
And it's hard to tell people you rap, like okay
Everybody rap, my cousin Joe rap down the street
He rapped over that "0-100," it's pretty sweet, uh-uh
Yo, so I don't know what to do
So I stack a bit of paper, cop a couple of shoes
It's therapeutic to a brother like me, what it do?
I haven't combed my hair in a couple of weeks, maybe two
Okay, maybe a couple of months, maybe 6
Same dude wearing dad pants, all white kicks
Got the pure money 4s with the silver eyelets
And a bad lil thing, she about 5'6"
Actually, I ain't got one
But them kicks that just dropped, yeah I got them
Yeah, yeah that's Ritchie with a T
But please don't forget it like a fat bitch at the beach
What's up?


It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
I ain't even tripping, it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
You can keep on talking, it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
I ain't even tripping, it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
You can keep on talking, it's whatever dude


I do this for my people who say, "Stepa, we believe in ya"
Rather starve to death than consume that shit they feeding ya
Kind of antisocial so not big on social media
I'm just out here doing shows with my team
Snap back to reality, work in the A.M
I swear it's like waking up from a perfect dream
All I need is a little reefer and a fifth of heen
Shit, I been an alchy since I was a teen
Now I'm damn near 30, fighting demons like Constantine
Stay fucking up, that's a reoccurring theme
Truthfully, I haven't been doing my best
Story of my life, I guess
I think it's time I digress
Shooting for positivity, let y'all develop negatives
Call my homies, fam they know me better than my relatives
Got squares in my circle but you know they still hella cool
Care less how you feel about me, it's whatever dude


It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
I ain't even tripping, it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
You can keep on talking, it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
I ain't even tripping, it's whatever dude
It's whatever dude, it's whatever dude
You can keep on talking, it's whatever dude

Album Cover:







I could be here all day. You're gonna tell me what I need to know. You're gonna tell me! Are you gonna tell me? C'mon, spit it out...
Me Ilamo Roberto, y este es el camino al Ã©xito.


Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?


My daddy taught me how to sell dope
Turn grams into elbows
Light it up when the L rolled
Black mask, used to kick doors
Wasn't no bullets in the guns though
Niggas still never argued
Raid the house like the task force
Me and my niggas like drug dogs
Find the dope then we take off
Fuck my girl with my chain on
Then she tatted my name on it
Yellowstone, I was raised on it
Actavis in my baby bottle
Baby stroller was an Impala
Niggas like to talk down on me
When I see 'em, I don't hear about it


Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?



Never would've met my friends if not for satellites
Yeah, I'll cuff her even if she do not suck me right 
Always planned to be a rapper when I failed at life
Luckily professor failed me at the proper time 
Shh-shh, shh, I say "please" all the time, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, I like white collar crime, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, money digital broke and
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your messages


I know you hate me for leavin'
Then let's go crazy together
When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
Just so that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will


Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?


You do not know me, don't speak of my homies, you are a phony
Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face 
Then turn their back and switch up words you say 
Running to the papers everyday 
I'm running to the paper anyway 


Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me  what ya say?





If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in '92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet


Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be


Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right


Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin' the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin', they fittin' to run up
Then they gettin' the come up, yup, bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas


Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be


Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right


I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad, my nigga


Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be





Ay, ay, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We're sayin', oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We got some old Jay-Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD won't let me keep it


I never speak it, keep it a secret
It'd be peak if any geezer would hear it and then repeat it
So we keep it, keep it out of reach of all the eejits
If you need it, best believe it, you won't see it
Locked up in my room, deep cocoon, like you're digging in crates
Already done with your digging, so your digging is bait
Keeping it straight, buzzing 'til late, sample the greats
Then we move onto the groove, grabbing that sample at eight
Seconds, loop beckons, smooth like new weapons
If I do step it, it's new repping with true brethrens
Ruth, Lou's getting too loose, look who's crepping all
Tunes through Jimi to Zeppelin, now who reckons
You knew you're rocking with a master of this
Manoeuvre blasts fast 'cause we're hard to resist
Blitz like it was vital, recited my recital
One back in the snapple, the snap, the crackle of the vinyl
Sweet onto repeat, Chris is chopping a beat
Flipping these verses like the burgers on the grill at Bodean's
We keep it mean, pristine, cleaner than clean
Harbour these harmonies like we're speaking to Jean, it's like


Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We're sayin', oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We got some old Jay-Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD won't let me


âCause this the rap, he brings the pads to the lab
The lab is my pad, weâre using every session to jam
Working on my revolutionary revenue plan
But currently without the green, like a recession in 'Dam
So we scribble on the daily, making beats for 'em
Create ancient plastic discs and playlists
That your parents used to play with
Quick and very painless
Stumbled onto rap, always been sick, my very name is
Now Iâm quick to leave you brainless
You anus, you ignoramus, just let me say this
Not the greatest, but gimme space, kid, Iâm set to make it
So basically, we're bringing it back to basics
Rocking hi-hats and big kicks that are the latest trend
Itâs a statement, but when you put this fashion aside
This rap music is a passion of mine, lifeline
'Cause I designed the illest rhymes, chillin', time keeps tickin'
But I'm high, keep spittin' and flippin' rhythms to vibe, like


Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We're sayin', oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We got some old Jay-Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD won't let me


Itâs like sixteen bars in sixteen minutes, I kill it
Extinguish all the fire from the liars and the gimmicks
Losing spirit, bredders putting cheddar over lyrics
Then diminish any vision when they clear it
I hear it, it's happening, moving like theyâre mannequins
Dressed by other brothers
Hiding under covers with mothers be panicking
Rambling, gassing like theyâre Anakin
But red and blue lights are out of sight
On the mic, stop damaging your honour and your pride
I, goner from the side
Never dippin' from the rhythm, flow specific when I rhyme
Sometime tell the flack and back, a slap
To any crackerjack who be slacking his mac
Iâm on the track and in my prime
Ease your mind if ya hold it, time if you chose it
Keep your spine straighter then a blind homophobic
Ease your mind if you hold it, your time if you chose it
And keep your spine straight tonight 


Oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We're sayin', oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
We got some old Jay-Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD


It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
It's like, oh please, we ain't got no P's
Because we spent all our money on some old CDs
Got some old Jay-Zs, couple ODBs
Place 'em up in perfect order 'cause my OCD won't let me keep it





She want a million dollars
Bet she can get it with a million swallows
Dig deep until it's hollow
Sheâs a knees and neck hoe
Cheese and check hoe
Skeet on the twice
She want to be the wife
She want to live the life
She want to know my real name
Know the real A
She don't want to play
She want the rings, she want the dress
Nothing less for her
She want the best
And she deserve it, yeah
I like the lines and teardrops
Fights and name calling
Checking my e-mails
Hoping I stop balling
Bitches they keep coming
And so I keep coming
She hating everything about me
But love something
I love the girl really
But love is so silly
One day is safe forever
The next she want to kill me
I just keep my composure
Never thinking it's over
If not, I just jump in the Rover and roll




Yo, she the baddest
Flash match kicks with fabrics 
Pat-patty cake, the fatty 
Addict of backs, back traffic pass half speed
Stripping for magic, moved out of Cali, uh
First dib, now the city's his
Mack skins, never tally, tryin' to counter in
Miss Valley fit thick like home mix, perform tricks
Dove tips swarm like Sandy when the storm hit
All hunnit's, nothing she need from 'em, but punishment
Lovin while leaving the Benz running
Crush us, lips, she been stuntin'
Snitch says something to sniff, but knows nothing
In her walls like soles in flow runners, summer nights
Swinging the wood like Jim Duggan
She still thuggin' in
We lovin' it
Miss Butter never knew her by her government 




Yeah, uh
Yeah, word up, you getting green
Spread it for that ass and spazz
Cause it's ya birthday
Throw it back to dad and crash
You got paper
Spend it like a bottom and swallow
Cause all day
All day you finna be sleepy hollow
Headless, yup
Make she can't call you back
 Why is that?
Cause she lives in my lap 
Make it slap and clap
Like a track with a hoe on it
Make dough on it, and throw it back
Hold it back, shit gets far from over
We've been drinking all day
And I'm far from sober
I thought I told ya
The mac need a poster
The lac with that ass to match
Call me owner
Like I own her, like you sold up
Like a soldier though
I bust for what
So keep your toe up
Tales and no females
And if you tell the story
Please, leave out the details





I must be a criminal 
Keep your talkin' minimal 
'Cause most of it's subliminal 
And it'll put you in a critical 
Used to be invisible 
They would refer to me as mythical 
Sippin' on Mastika, yeah, I sip it slow 
Not on my level, not on your tippy-toes 
Walk in the bank and I yell, "Gimme those" 
Hot as a stove, yeah, I'm wearin' Fendi clothes 
I'm want my spot, yeah, look at Wendy nose 
My niggas eatin', they gettin' minerals 
If you throw shots, then you know my men'll roll 
Up on your block, now you lookin' pitiful 
Tinted the windows, I need a minute, yo 
I'll leave your missus all mad and miserable 
You picked the wrong time to pick a fight
Your bitch a dyke, she think she Ike
You sippin' on a drink that's spiked
Enough for you to say goodnight
For the rest of your life
I know your sons won't miss you
I did a favor for them niggas
Took a loss to a winner
Rick Ross, you been dinner
You ain't fly, I make your wings stop
I'm real as fuck and your ring's not
Fresh as hell like a king's socks
Your real car is a slingshot
Don't need a gun, I use a slingshot
If I was a beverage
You would have to drink hot


Got a job I gotta do 
I get down and dirty, too 
What it is? What it do? 
Same shit, nothin' new

Havin' flashbacks, where yo' past at?
Where the cash at? Ayo, pass that
I will stab backs just for bags, racks
Front on me and I'll punch yo' ass flat
Are you okay? Please don't ask that
I don't act black, got a fat cat
You a rat-rat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat-a-tat-tat
Tattoos, but you can't see 'em
Ice cold, yeah, I'm goin' skiin'
I get around at the Colosseum
Used to roam around with no pot to pee in
I was pissed off
Get away with murder like Christophe
You get crisscrossed in the big loft
I'm a big boss
So much sauce, I drip broth
The wait is over, I'm takin' over 
You're overweight, you ate a soda 
I'm super sober, you doin' coke 
Coca-Cola 
Ahead of you, like a closure 
When Troy died, I had to find some closure 
Don't push me, bitch, I am not a stroller 
Pop off on a nigga like bread in toaster 
Double D-cup, you should use a coaster 
I'm on the post, I need the deal like kosher 
So I shop it over, blue faces 
And I call 'em Grovers 
Butter pecan Rover, I'm that odor 
Wanna be like me when I get older 
Talked to God, then he came over 
Talked to God, then he came over 


Got a job I gotta do 
I get down and dirty, too 
What it is? What it do?

Ain't got no standards , I'm kinda passive 
Rich Swann, we gon' cash in 
Dust off the ratchets

Look, I wish, I wish a nigga would, man
Look, I wish a nigga would try to test me

Look, man

I'm a thug, I don't play with no rap beef
Fuck around, end up on the backstreet

No time, y'all gassed up for the new line, uh
I'll make a nigga cry at his own pad
I'll make a nigga cry for his dead dad
I'll make a nigga cry for his fat wife
I'll make a nigga cry for-
I'll make a nigga cry for help
I'll make a nigga cry for himself 






Jungle juice music
Uh, new whips, new whips, uh
New whip with the top, woah
Hold up, not even


New whip with the top dropped 
Suplex a nigga like ascension, the cop dropped 
I ain't got no million dollar deals, I still make hits
These niggas got million dollar deals and just take shit
I'm not with it, scope wide, I got good vision
I'm seein' through these fake niggas like Bran, you niggas too timid
A little loose-lippin', I'm in the booth sippin'
Cyanide to the head, bitch, I be big sinnin'
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout? I'm into givin' coffins out

Empty out the safe, put the money on the ground
Bitch, I love it
Heartthrob Peggy, I'm above it
I ain't got no fuckin' tickets, I ain't got no fuckin' money
I ain't got no fuckin' digits

You can call me but Peggy-taker 'cause I can't let these niggas-

Damn, damn, I'm frosty
Blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camo, I'm drowning
But you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's, hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me, punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', book learnin'
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn


Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters
'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight


Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
 Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
 Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect


Keep a gold chain

Pull my case, boy , I beat that shit like Lennon beat his bae
Young O'Shea 
I need a bitch with long hair like Myke C-Town 
You talking shit , I'm talking shit, you catch a beat down 
I know you never in the hood or in the streets now 
And still, I'm hearin' that you really want some beef now? 
Bruh, take your tree out my backwood
Made the beat 'cause I'm that good 
Got your girl on her hands , Johnny 5 with the cans 
Fuck a blog, fuck a fan, hope my record get panned 
'Least I made you niggas dance
Fuck 12, nigga, stamp


Oh, your body, oh, you got it
On my body, my body, on my body
Oh, your body, oh, you got it






Man, now they go 
I cut off some friends, where they go?

I stick to the plan, that's the goal

Fuck these niggas man 


Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him


Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go?
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man, that's for sure


Say
Uno the shoe, red with the blue
Look like a flag, what the fuck it do?
Golf be the set, no more OF
Like Ron Artest, bitch, we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect
Yeah, that way, fuck your accolades
But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me Brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91 
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade, yeah it's Minute Maid
I been gettin' paid, pockets gainin' weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you


Man, now they go

I cut off some friends, where they go?

I stick to the plan, that's the goal

Fuck these  niggas man, that's for sure 


Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah

Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon

And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch youâre a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause okra


Man, now they go
I cut off some friends





Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know


I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach 


Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street


I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach 


Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smoking out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop-block the corner
Giving hell 'til it's frozen over
I ain't never ran from nothing


I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete 
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes


Ayy, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete, uh
I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store, go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm in LA eatin' twenty-two course
Young boss, bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoeboxes
Mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes, wear 'em out
Hit the club, bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream, they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin', they should give me a degree
Good liquor, what I'm sippin' isn't cheap, uh
Finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet


And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes 
Nike-Nike-Nikes , Nike-Nike-Nikes 
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes


I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippens on my feet, they the throwbacks, look
My money good, but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads, uh
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm doin' well
Smokin' all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now, we're sellin' tapes out my shoebox
Any spot, just set up my shop
You're mad that your girl always says that I'm hot
She buyin' my t-shirts, but she spendin' your guap, uh
Say, "What up?" if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground, it's just


And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes 
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

Give it to me with the clothes off
You could even take the gold off
We don't need no trinkets, honest as Abe Lincoln
Why do it feel like I take it?
What's so hard about the naked truth?
I scream about it 'til I change it, oh
And still I wonder am I breaking through at all


But hey, but hey we look good

We a real nice black

Dark chocolate
Ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't gotta front, I know what you want
I can meet you where you at
With the naked truth


Ayy, ayy
Talk dirty to me with it too
Give me how it takes
Give me proof
Give a chance to prove that a man improved
I'ma say I grew
They gon' say I pulled a switcharoo
But they is who?
All that jogging in place is cool
But that shit stayed in school for me partly because somebody was brutally honest
Pointed out social constructs I foolishly honored
I booted these false concepts that diluted these waters
Was trying to be true to the nigga I was claiming to be
Now I'm really real
Trying to get old like a philly shell
Don't nobody want no smoke with me, from spoken words to poetry
To polarizing social content posted I got more of the type
And it all took a sprite from advice
That one wouldn't considered nice
That's alright, it helped me take flight
I used to fall but the floor is so velvety
That we still had the Velveeta stacking nice
Rarely flexing or advertising
I ain't stressing too hard


But hey, but hey we look good

We a real nice black

Dark chocolate
Ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't gotta front, I know what you want
I can meet you where you at
With the naked truth


I dare you to strip it down
It's plenty dollars out here to pay you to keep it on
You'll pop your collar as long as you go and play the role
I'm popping bottles of starch niggas know I can't fold
I hope your water is as smart as you claim to be online
They call you by your username offline
I usually pay no mind
I just cannot get used to niggas using that shit to define themselves
You'll lose me every time trying to align myself with real niggas
You confuse me every time you say you're feeling free
Can't see where my ceiling be
Think that's why those trapped in boxes can't see where I'm coming from
We just ain't there mentally
Expose myself to myself
What the fuck you running from fam?
We can feel your energy
The hate gon' always cost you sort of love, it's complementary
Wallet full of centuries, I still can't get that time back
Protect the pocket like a lineback
Where these niggas draw the line at?
Don't let me find out that they don't draw one at all
I spit the naked truth, I'm drawing it raw
I speak on it all, not peaking at all
No rallies in sight, I rally to fight


With the naked truth





You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told yaÂ 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up


The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 


The roof is on fire, she wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, they hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy, them stars falling, don't chase 'em


The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 


Attack on Iraq, it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And Iâm a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-


The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 


All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn  to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree



The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash 
The sky's falling, baby
Falling, baby, falling 





Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight


I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
And I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
She said that orphans morph into abortions without precaution
Problem with our people, there's too many wannabe Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
Too many wannabe actors instead of achieving their masters
At least a bachelors but no, too many wannabe rappers, hah
That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
On Jim Crow laws, you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence


It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis


Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
Look them in the eye, if looks made you die, you know you merk âem
Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like quite scared
But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
And donât you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
Just let 'em disappear in the night air, yeah, with yo' Nike Airs
Robbed by the crackheads left alone in the apartments
Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
Since he gain knowledge, Iâm keeping it with the synopsis, and
Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again


It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis


It's a war out here, mad niggas is dyin'
You don't want that shit to be you, right? 
I know you gon' hold it down though, you know what I mean?
Just be careful, man, cause niggas out here ain't really worth it
You a ill nigga though, I like ya style, son


Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
Po' never, blow Berettas âcause I, know no better
No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
No school, no OG, no talent, no me
What if I just ain't act right?
What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
And give my friends the back knife cause that's life, nigga


It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this

Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here

Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T


Who dat boy? Who him is?

Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?


Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?

Why you niggas feel like that?

Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya 
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
 And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frÃ­o
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way gÃ¼ey, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone


Fuck





FnZ
Oh, damn


First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'


My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"


I'ma act, one, two, stop the track
Bring it back, what it do?
See, Ricky said, "Never let nobody get the one up on you
If they run up on you, hit 'em with a one, two or a bitch slap
Leave the cul-de-sac, your brothers gon' have your back regardless
And stick with your day one homies that was here before you started
And fear no man but the man above your head"
"Pray before you go to bed," every day my mama said

And your mama ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit

With the all-black faded Dickie with the Raider fit
That was it, we was lit, y'all wasn't even shit yet 
We was Three 6, Wu-Tang mixed with Dipset
Ricky used to take me to my first shows ever
Would only drop jewels way before they dropped cheddar

Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear, and your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair, it's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, âvroom-vroom,â ho
Ain't nobodyâ

Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
âErr-eh-err-eh,â onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on! 
I'm winnin' so they had to dump the Gatorade 
And I don't give a fuck about my family name


What?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do? 





Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time

Alright, I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah, I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man

So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes, your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh, forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga, can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry, have this sandwich
Got my wallet, cheese, and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'?
Runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
'Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough

Nat Turner would be so proud of me

And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow



Tick, tock

Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized

Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden


And I just handle all my business like a chessboard

And at them Golf boys? That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from abroad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to  they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me

Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down

Never should've gave niggas money
Got fat 'cause there used to be nothing in my tummy
Got my foot up in the door and all my niggas coming
And Parker so smart that he got y'all all dummy
Was pretty bad before, now I'm just reckless
Apple Ciroc for dinner, lunch and breakfast
You know how it goes, if you got it, better spend it
And if you ain't got it, I suggest you go and get it

Might stash a little, I ain't going out like Hammer
Can't spare to save my life but getting money from my Grandma
The boy so charming, I get it from my grammar
Now I ain't got a lot, but it's more than a little bit
Same old Groggs, I ain't out here getting ignorant
But I'd be lying though if I said I'm not belligerent
I guess that's just the life when you're out here killing shit


Yeah, yeah, I'm out here killing shit, massacre, killing shit
Maybe not a little bit, okay, not even a little bit
You get it? Yeah? A little bit, okay, I'm sounding ignorant
Spent my last 50 cents out my fucking piggy bank
They ain't got no veggies shit on the dollar menu man
Now a nigga hungry but my 'fit is on Pootie Tang
Yep, unruly man, 'fit is on Pootie Tang
Graduated from Cooley man nigga gone do his thing

Attract heavy cash cause the game's centrifugal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown nosing nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like a old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire, testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican


Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here

Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah, yeah, tell 'em tell it on the mountain hill
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap 
Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rapp snitch knishes


You know what I'm saying? 
Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game
This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching

Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man
 Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga
You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging
Fake hustling nigga, heheheheh, haha
Perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here...







Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak


Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue


Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?


Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue


So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish


Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue


I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy 


Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue


La la la la





Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell molly and mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding


Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high


Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
Hope they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back


Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high


What's in my trunk? White, girl
What's in my trunk? White, girl
You need a warrant, officer


You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven
Drums







Um, excuse me mister, but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? 
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada but let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named my album "Cherry Bomb" because "Greatest Hits" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; "Who's in charge of this Golf shit?"
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick."
It's young T


I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
You better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life


Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair

This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp

You should be mine in a way tonight






I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"

All my life man I want fast cars, NASCARs
All my life I want runway stars, Kate Moss
All my life I want waves at my front door
No green grass, no porch
I just want sea shores
All my life
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
Told me lies, told me lies


I'm in that 745

Eyes can't hide your hate for me
Maybe you was made for the Maybelline
Spent so much tryna park the car
Barely got a tip for the maÃ®tre d'
You head straight to the oyster bar
I tread light each time we speak
Play too rough might break ya heart
And them glass shoes ain't made to walk
These lonely streets
Unpaved, unscathed
Morning dew's giving you the coldest feet
Said that you was comin' through after dark
To look at the stars and hardly speak
This thing called love real hard for me
This thing called love is a God to me
And we all just God's property
So feel free to fulfill the prophecy


Adam, Eve
Apple trees
Watch out for the snakes baby
Open streets
Ocean breeze
We should get away, baby


I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

I'm back!


I'm here and y'all know they've been waitin' for me
Since I was fifteen, now I'm Yella, a hundred miles and runnin', uh
Easy come and easy go, that's why I work 'til midnight
I'm out of town, shorty very dirty on the turnpike
My piss clean, I caught a case, it happens to the best
The lawyer said don't smoke
I'm like, "Good Lord, boodah keep me blessed"
I'm buyin' Nike stock when I see these checks
Motivated by niggas because it's bigger than me
I know that, I might go back to my old shit
Bring the fro back, that's a throwback, yeah
Watch your mouth, why you tryna talk like you know somethin'?
My competition is myself, therefore I ain't worried 'bout no one
Not a soul, pot of gold
Lookin' like a stain, niggas'll wet your mug
Leave you behind yourself, you're playin' catch up
Boy, is that your blood?
'Cause I done blew inside my mind since I first wrote a rhyme
Y'all all late, rappers be stuck in the booth, I'm All State
They're imposters, steak and lobster
Surf my turf, better wear your chopper
Next to Oprah at the opera, okay
If you had


Everything you'd ever wanted
Right in front of me, what's it gonna be?
The lights and the drugs and the girls finally drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drive me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drive me crazy


Gotta love it though, they hatin', homie
I be on Sunset, still go back to 68th and Stony
Cooked out my basement
Dropped my tape and got my homies' placements
I'll play the keys in my sleep on the beach, that's a dream vacation
Say you ain't heard, I'll let you lie, just know you digged your grave
No turnin' back once you done found
That that's the hand you played
Game over, on the drivin' range in the Range Rover
Halfway sober with my middle finger up, fuck these hoes
I'm a tiger in the jungle in the middle of the summer
With the wood on me and a fiend for the snow
 She a fiend for the blow, I'm a G, to the code
You know me, I need Keke Palmer off TLC for that T.O.P
Keys to the Jeep and the deed to the boat
Y'all cruisin', y'all losin'
Yeah, I make pop music, still the king with the flow
This just the shit I've been thinkin' about, uh


Picture everything you ever want, want, want, want
Right in front of you
The lights and the drugs and the girls finally drives me crazy
Drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drive me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drive me crazy







Big cheese pilin' 
You speed dialin', you talk shit
But I keep smilin' 
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage 
At your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge 
You glad when I never had shit
But mad I got it 


Niggas wanna turn their back 
She don't wanna fuck no more 
I'ma be that nigga some day 
Lost a couple friends along the way 
Even in the end you could never end me
Still in the hood and I still sip tea
When I go in, I'ma go for the win
On point like syringe and it's like that
Living life full of sin, gotta cup full of Hen'
Put my tears in a pen and I write back
Ice pack 'cause my heart, lost
I'm so cold that I Jack, Frost
I'm 'bout be on the upper echelon
Niggas gonna hate on the man that I become


Big cheese pilin' 
You speed dialin', you talk shit
But I keep smilin' 
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage 
At your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge 
You glad when I never had shit
But mad I got it 


Niggas wanna take my life 
Police never read my rights 
Only wanna fuck me for the fame 
Another rapper hit it in the same 
Niggas ain't shit and the hoes ain't loyal
Really gonna hate when they can't destroy you
Then expect the royal treatment
Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin'
Down to earth, 'til my soil weaken
Venomous words, watching the poison leakin'
Bandana on my motherfuckin' face 
.38 on my motherfuckin' waist 
When you see me better man up
Better make like a roller coaster, put your hands up


Big cheese pilin' 
You speed dialin', you talk shit
But I keep smilin' 
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage 
At your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge 


Mad I got it, mad I got it




Hate the government, capital punishment
I keep a heater on my hip, don't need an oven mitt
I'm on some other shit, mind is twisted
I wear this mask every day â Stanley Ipkiss
Realistic views, a pessimistic blues
I sing along, who's got me on my crip shit
Lipstick, long kiss from the devil lips
Moonlit, two hits from the cannabis 
Death knocking at my door, who could it be?
Life not sweet like suit wit' an E
Try to read me, would it be, Stephen King
Big cheese only bring me Misery 
Insane with no brain, I'm low zane
No fame and no thangs is so strange
Do things that I don't see violent
Stick a nigga up cause I'm mad he got it


Got it, got it
Cause I'm mad he got it, got it





Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runninâ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, "grrr", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
âYou're my favorite rapper nowâ, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?â
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one


It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about


You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, "First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Ow"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until thereâs nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch








Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "Yah!"
Bad trips like, "Yah!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright


Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright


Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say


Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright


Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright


What you want you, a houseâ ? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God


Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright


I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers


I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers







I'm the only star, I shoulda left âem 'fore they fall
Put in so much work, I check in like a 9 to 5
They protectin' shit, Iâm feelin' how I do in love
I can't even lie, I think I was really high


Rolex on a wrist watch, bitch, I'm Chris Rock
And these niggas always hating me, but they binge watch
I should have a show on Netflix that they friends watch
Copped the dealer, now we're reckless
I'm a big boss like I'm Rick Ross


Yeah, man
You niggas already know what the fuck going on, man
I'm lying
Apollo 21, you fuck niggas better catch up, man
This shit over, this shit is over
Steve Lacy


Call me number two âcause really, I think Iâm the shit
You be talking 'bout that money, money, you donât get
You be talking 'bout the pussy, pussy, you don't hit
You be sucking dick, you be, you be sucking dick


Apollo double-X-I, fuck a double-X-L
I've been eating my greens, Iâve been eating my kale
All these niggas, they chips, all these niggas, they stale
I'm so, I'm so hot, you'd think I was from Hell


Outro, outro, out, out, outro, out

Please take the wheel forever
With you, I feel no effort
Show me the way to never
Land where you stay forever

I went from stickin' pennies in the jar to offshore bank accounts
See me and my conglomerates is lucrative
I'm talkin' big money, big chains, big guns, nigga
More power


Big talk, speedboat 
Pray to God I don't get repoed 
Didn't go to college for a free throw 
People gettin' killed through the peephole 
Have your money up before you go to war 
Put the mask on like a luchador 
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Put the mask on like a luchador 
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24


Put a red beam to your head like Arby's
Either go to school, go to jail or the army
Keep a close eye on the things tryna harm me
Warn me if anybody try to swarm me, uh
Invest in the rock and a Rottweiler
Pile up hella stacks when the bills pile up
Dollar is the only way to get the style up
Riled up, catchin' motherfuckers usin' dial-up
My dawg is gone and the result is to have my teflon
Christian Dior and the fashion beyond
Talkin' Polo, call me Polow da Don
Throw some D's on the donk
I got hella keys and the funk
I put hella Gs in the vault
It took only three to assault, damn


Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my Desert Eagle

Pourin' out scotch
Gas, all in my brain, it fumigated my thoughts
Thinking 'bout intricate plots
To get out the hood, that's when I started to jot
Not givin' the opportunity to let the devil ruin me, no
Even though the jewelry froze, ice cubes get Deeboed
Word on the street, everything heat
Everything hot boy, Texas Pete
Pulled up in a Lexus and a Jeep
All black, no tag, time for the sweep
Too many guns, too many sons
Lost in the river of blood in these streets
Master of none, pastors and nuns
Let's bow our heads for the ceremony


Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my desert eagle


Big talk, speedboat

You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, "What a goddess" 
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest 
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris 
Fuck the government and fuck Boris 
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh

Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts 
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts

Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie , way too exclusive 
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive 
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit 
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business

Baddin' up the game, bad it up again 
Had 'em up before, have 'em up again 
Fake bruddas, man, your mandem all pretend

Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga


Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker

They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took

To a MAC sponsor just to up my pretty
Fees is changing so Iâm high-saditty
Avoiding fake fuckers who claim they fucking with me
Dickriders trying to match my witty
Had to cleanse my palate, appetite too picky
All this "hit me, get me" got my mood all pissy
Foreign labels keep me feeling frisky
Steady hating, whatâs the ishy?
Iâm the MVP so bitches cannot bench me
Groupies on me when Iâm in they city
Bet you want this lifestyle cause it sounds so kinky
Feeling cocky, iced out the pinky
And if you kiss the don, donât leave no hickies, yup!


Yup, whatâs goodie?
Iâm the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it 'til it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy


See? Yup, whatâs goodie yo
Been the hottest round since a nigga ate Cheerios
Man, Parker flipping shit like his ass Rey Mysterio
Yeah, 619! Yeah, that use to be the area code
Now a nigga been all around like a Mary-go
Turn this shit loud if you hear it on the stereo
A nigga about to go JosÃ© Canseco
Ya a nigga about to go Jose, shitâs scary, yo
Remember when they were like âOh shit, you on the radio!â
Now these niggas like âOh, Groggs? That nigga very oldâ
We be like, âChill out, nigga, hear me outâ
You just mad thereâs only ten likes on your video
Yeah, but thereâs like twenty niggas standing in your video
How that work out? Thatâs a 50/50 ratio
You just that bad, nigga, you might have to let it go
Yeah, yeah, and that hairline, nigga, you might have to let it go


Yeah! Whatâs goodie?
Iâm the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it 'til it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy
Erp! What's goodie?
Iâm the hottest around, my city
I got all the sounds, got plenty
You should ask around, my city
Yerp! Get to work, get busy
Do it 'til it hurt, get busy
You should go berserk, get busy
I'ma make you work, get busy


Whatâs goodie?
My city
Got plenty
My city
Get busy
Get busy
Get busy
Whatâs goodie?


Yup, whatâs really good?
Iâm the hottest motherfucker in my neighborhood
Even if I came to yours, yo, I probably would
Okay, maybe not if you live in Hollywood
I might pull up, I might skrrt off
In the Pathfinder with the Birks on
Or the 4Runner with the Hares on
And your girl still mad I cut my hair off
Cause itâs Ritchie with a motherfuckin' T
I got a classic tape, plus a degree
Okay, not yet, I need another year
Iâll have another classic, plus my Grandmaâs cheers
I ainât tryna be no motherfucking engineer
Iâma get my mom a crib with a rap career
And a 6 series, make the roof disappear
So she can never say âThere ainât no fucking room in here," yup!




Bridges to burn, tables to turn
Work hard while you're young til you crash and burn

Cancel your phone bill, get a bowl, eat your breakfast

Bridges to burn, tables to turn
Work hard while you're young til you crash and burn
Don't stress and don't flex to them corporate operators
Cancel your phone bill, get a bowl, eat your breakfast

I put my cornflakes on the counter
Turn on the radio
Take a second to re-encounter my previous experiences and how they have counted
My grievous tendencies
My not so easy entries, my faults and my entities
Your name comes to mind, but it's not unusual this time and a mirror breaks just at the thought of my smile
It still hasn't left my side, this baggage that I carry, it's heavy and oversized
I'm not sure what is inside but I can't shake the feeling that it's something I have to hide
That it's something I have to move
Donât stress about my life yeah just listen to the groove

Bridges to burn, tables to turn

Hold up
Isn't it about time that we blow up
Take an anadin
My heads in bits
Iâm bout throw up
And you know what
Drank too much to know what
Yeah taxi back to the flat
You know iâm gonna show up
Then Itâs back into bed
Time to go to rest my head
Better get some sleep cause Iâve a lecture at 10
I wake up in the morning
With my head in the bin
The sun in my eyes
Iâm never drinking again
Ugh

Talkin' 'bout timin'
Wake up like five in the mornin' 'fore the sun come up
I'm grindin'
Shitâain'tâalways black andâwhite, sometimes you gotta find aâsilver linin'
Hit me with the Clockwork Orange, I'll dodge that bullet
Still shinin'


Look, baby I was on time
I ain't tryna wait more than fifteen minutes
If you got a J, add fifteen minutes
I was on the way, I was speedin' just to get
Yeah, I stopped on a dime
If you talkin' 'bout time
Wastin' it should be a crime
Look, you ain't gotta front, just say somethin'
Wearin' sun shades in the night time
You ain't gotta search for the right time
I already seen you from the front, you was curvy
Got the message and I'm operatin' likewise
Like Drizzo while I'm puffin' on the Percy
Little Dragon happened twice in my lifetime
Why you had to take it to the max when you swervin'?
But your clock wound up, you was perfect


Talkin' 'bout timin'
Wake up like five in the mornin' 'fore the sun come up
I'm grindin'
Shit ain't always black and white, sometimes you gotta find a silver linin'
Hit me with the Clockwork Orange, I'll dodge that bullet
Still shinin'


Early bird gets the worm
That ain't always true, my nigga, check this
I was pressed, I was permed
Read the DM, ran a curl pattern back
I was sick, she ain't my concern no more
Puff, pass, dump ash in the urn, R.I.P. the mornin'
I can't confirm that a nigga gon' vibe
Either way, a bitch live, we can keep it goin'
If we talkin' 'bout time, I've been wakin' up five in the a.m.
Grindin', I need it more
Dreamin' through alarms 'til I find it
I know I'm right behind it
Shawty still denyin' me, I need to know


I already seen it from the front, she was curvy
If you talkin' 'bout timin'





Yeah, run up on ya bitch like
Probably run up on ya bitch like


Lord, can I get a bad bitch?
High class whip, be above the average
Headed north west, that two seater Kardashian
Type to give me brain up in the red light traffic
And keep ya head up, that 2Pac blasting
Face two sacks and then we back into this action
No time to relax, I need someone to count this cash with
That match with, give me what I'm askin'
The lady in the streets, a pure beast on that mattress
That's it, you're the only one I'm trying to mack with
But you could be a liability or fat ass-et
How real is that ass miss? Bend that shit backwards
Hit one backwood, crack the pussy like a password
Bet that pussy's last word is master
Ask her, rode my rocket til I made that astronaut
That's NASA'S thought, be that young fly, nasty one
Swallow the seeds, please, but you can't catch me slipping, hon


So let's just ride away
We could die today
Got no time to waste
So just roll with me, baby
Ride or die
Always by your side
Until the end of time
Driving me crazy


First thing's first, I, Joey
Freaks all the honeys, mommies, the playboy bunnies
The hoes love me, get down before the money
Just know shit could get ugly, but whether it rain or sunny
Just never worry, chinchillas in February
Vanilla, that's when you ready
Check the itinerary whenever it's necessary
Keep my baby straight, peep my lady lace
The Margiela to Doneva
Fool less it's planned and everything is in control
So hit the gas and let's go
It's  no sleep til Brooklyn, another beastie boy
And she just can't stop looking, she like it raw
Real spitter and all and that's the word of mouth
And let her sit in the jaw
I'm so nasty, please just walk past me
So tempted to grab it, I gotta have it
We could be living lavish so tell me, girl, right away
We could hit the bank then escape to the hideaway
Is you riding, riding with me?
Is you riding?
Is you riding, riding with me?
Is you riding?


So let's just ride away
We could die today
Got no time to waste
So just roll with me, baby
Ride or die
Always by your side
Until the end of time
Driving me crazy


Getting head in the whip and not crashing it
FILA Velour shorts set, half Arabic
I sit in dark room with candle lit
Tell little mama handle it
Or you could leave the sandals on and pull your skirt up
I really remember reading Word Up
Tiger Beat, see me on the cover soon, fold out posters
Hanging on your shorties wall
I still be fucking women half my age when I'm 44
Young skin, a winning personality
Hard dick, million dollar salary
These cheating refs calling fouls on me
Break the fucking whistle off in his ass, now hit the road, Jack
Hop off the bozack, the .44 clap
You'll need LoJack to find your ho back
Euros'll get down, you know that
Swimming trunks and throwback
Yeah, you know that ah


So let's just ride away
We could die today
Got no time to waste
So just roll with me, baby
Ride or die
Always by your side
Until the end of time
Driving me crazy





Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokinâ, niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish, told him it's a feelinâ
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream


I said peace to my dirty water drinkers
Psh, nobody tryna get it clean
Why ain't nobody tell me I was sinkin'?
Ain't nobody tell me I could leave
Yeah, we'd win again, seethinâ within
Seen teeth on the floor, leakinâ again
We hold the door, uh
We build the bridge, we hold the courts
Send a cease and desist to your thieves, nigga
Please do abort, I could feel when you're forcinâ it
Still in a bore riddim
Boy, I take the tour chips and go and get some decent decor
Is you gon' ribbit or will you jump?
Get some more ribbons for the born winners from the jump
Niggas don't listen 'til they whole mission was a bust
No sit-up, but itâs crunch time, shootin' in the clutch
The midsummer sunshine found me on my ones, face drippin', uh
Hate swimmin' through your bloodlines
Motherfuck the judge, same goin' to the one time, yeah
Come and take a stroll in the mud
Dip a toe in it, heard the hammer like a grudge
When you holdin' it close, we was on the cusp
It was holes in the boat, we ain't make a fuss
Uh, chosen


Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokin', niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish, told him it's a feelin'
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream





What you say?


Woke up in the morning
Broke all my chains
Money's my language
But I'm nobody's slave
Open my eyes
See the crabs in the barrel
'Cause I'm on the rise
An American pharaoh


Ahh, Iâm young and Iâm black in America
They try to attack and embarrass us
Y'all don't want your daughters to marry us
But they love this dick so I tear it up
Got her wetter than mariners
Half of society scared of us
My nigga I'm young with no barriers
So if you owe me money just ante up
Police killed my best friend, they shot him dead
I do not forgive, I do not forget
My life is a cliff and I'm by the ledge
And in less than a moment, a lot is said
But if you don't know me, do not allege
The thoughts in my head, you cannot arrest
I see that as a promise and not a threat
I don't answer my phone if it's not a check
I'm on plus, your money on minus
No love for the righteous, just call me your highness
You can't bite this, my flyness science
No time for bullshit, I require silence
People wanna bottle my virus
Sneeze on the track, it came out of my sinus
But you won't see no sign of survivors
So I sped off, hear the sound of my tires


Woke up in the morning
Broke all my chains
Money's my language
But I'm nobody's slave
Open my eyes
See the crabs in the barrel
'Cause I'm on the rise
An American pharaoh 
Woke up in the morning
Broke all my chains
Money's my language
But I'm nobody's slave
Open my eyes
See the crabs in the barrel
'Cause I'm on the rise
An American pharaoh


Ahh, I'm young and I'm black in America
They stop and they frisk us and jail us up
I don't understand what they jealous of
See they crucify us and nail us up
And there is no such thing as privilege
That was not in the curriculum
This is the world that I'm living in
Like I'm only one-third of a citizen
But fuck it, I'm getting my money up
Three ain't company when you wanna be number one
Second and third place, I don't wanna be none of 'em
After all of the effort, how could I settle for runner-up?
Give 'em a foot, they take a mile and run 'em amok
I went through a drought, no one was hittin' my number up
I used to be stuck in my own head like what was up
But sometimes shit can go downhill when you coming up
They try to divide up, my kingdom with violence
They know I'm a tyrant, they riot, we hose 'em, and fight 'em
Take they gold and they diamonds
Then hang them by rope with no trials
No Jesus Christ for your crisis
I'm just raking in green like I'm Irish
With no ocean to part every sea is too narrow
I rose from the battle, an American pharaoh


Woke up in the morning
Broke all my chains
Money's my language
But I'm nobody's slave
Open my eyes
See the crabs in the barrel
'Cause I'm on the rise
An American pharaoh


What you say?

I got angels runnin' 'way, I got demons huntin' me
I know 'Pac was 25, I know Jesus 33
I tell Death to keep a distance, I think he obsessed with me
I say, "God, that's a woman," I know she would die for me
They want a barcode on my wrist 
To auction off the kids
That don't fit their description of a utopia 
Like a problem won't exist if I just don't exist
If I grew up without a single pot to piss in
Pardon me for ventin'
Congress got the nerve to call theyself religious
Rich just gettin' richer, we just tryna live our life


Momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died
I was honor roll, talking to my father on the phone
Left the city when I was just four
None of them will get along
Momma beggin' him for winter coats
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook now they tryna take hisâ


Life don't mean shit to a nigga that ain't never had shit, yeah
Light don't mean lit in the dark, fight don't mean fists, ooh
Eyes don't see, eyes don't see, ice don't freeze
Light don't leave, I don't mean lie to me


Tell me it'll be okay, tell me happier days
Tell me that she my bae, that I won't be alone
Tell 'em I'll be okay when he ask, "How's my day?"
Tell 'em that we the same, tell em' that we not safe


I got my grandaddy soul, I'm at war, that's on my mind
I seen Walter body cold, wish I could switch it with mine
I'm not worried 'bout no rap shit, distractions or waste-of-times
I still go to social functions even though I'm so antiâ
No, I'm no Rihanna, the court gonna throw it like Donovan
Down a bit, I just been modelin' my whole career
As if 'Pac was here, studio monitors shakin'
I raise the apartments, I'm Bono with profit
I made what I made in allotted
Amount of time, the same amount of time you was watchin'
So stop comparing me to people; no, I am not them
A lot of people dream until they shit'll getâ*gunshot*


That's life, momma mixed the vodka with the Sprite
They killed my cousin with a pocket knife
While my uncle on the phone
He was gone for more than half my life
He got out a year and then he died

Left the city when I was just four
None of them will get along
Momma beggin' him for winter coats
I was chillin' with my nigga Spook, now they tryna take his life





Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!


They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Ummm
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam 
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigâger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned



Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone


Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48"? Motherfucker, I'm great 
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like 
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now"


Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone


How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
 Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, Iâm a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, Iâm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos


Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone


How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me 
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, likeâ


Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry

Where's the Talcum? Powder, when I smack niggas
Palm itchin', Napalms, we bomb business
Battle the strategist, it's just a game of battleship
Nayvadious the futuristic version of an avid kid
Actavis, everybody lean on me
Got them bags full of goodies like I'm CeeLo Green
Who the fuck tryna mob out?
I been on my job, no need to call out
Turn your crib into a game of Fallout
You put me in the water, bet I crawl out
Alligator swag, can't do with the navigator swag 
Viewer discretion upon my beat selection
You came with aggression, now your neck gon' need protection
 Watch 'em come with the water hose
Make it rain on the bitch, that's how you water hoes
Make it rain with the clip for those that all oppose
Put they face in the box inside a centerfold
Fire flows like I'm red and white Mario
Zeltron out the barrio, cold as Ontario
These niggas hysterical, I'm historical
I am the oracle, I been know what's in store for you


No, wait

For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
 I slipped myself some pink Xannies 
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin

Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? 
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn


Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah
Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah


They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
 Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
 That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead

Girl, I ain't no starâI just ain't from round here
My pilot told me I'll go far if I stay from 'round here
Hell, I'm so good at missing calls, bitch, I'm perfect this year
And I suggest you trace your scars if you get lost, my dear


Nigga, I can't tell if I'm dreaming
Lord, forgive me if I think I'm in charge
But the snakes in the grass are starting to get smart
And the snake in my pants is starting to get hard
And I'm fucking everything with two legs and a heart
And some ass, and some titties, and an ATM card
Fetish for my flaws, and I lust for my scars
And this broke nigga dick guarantee I won't starve
Well I suppose, that you suppose, using hoes, is getting old
And you oppose, that maybe I, should grown on up, and iron clothes
And find some hope, find some work, and write in cursive
Been a flirter since my birth
They wrapped me up so I ain't fuck the nurse
Too numb to react when you struck a nerve
So I hits the bitch in a circle jerk
With me, myself, and my demon semen
Canine teeth got me feline fiendin'
Hold up, rewind, make a beeline, feel like a bald eagle chiefin'
I ain't even breathin'
I'm a motherfuckin' ghost, you can tell 'cause I float
And I lose my head without even bleeding
Fuck what a motherfucker thought, that they knew about us
We got the juice and we keep on squeezing
Like drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Hold up me cup, me take a sip
Hold up me pinky, me think me rich
Me being foolish, me no pay rent
Me look at roomies, all of em pissed
Eviction notice taped to the fridge
Thank the most high, me no got kids
They would be cannibals, eating your kids



Girl I ain't no star, I just ain't from round here
My pilot told me I'll go far if I stay from round here

Hell I'm so good at missing calls, bitch I'm perfect this year

And I suggest you trace your scars if you get lost, my dear



I done had all night to think about this
I done had all life to think about this
Get a plate with strife and two sides of shit
Let me click my heels and toss on them grits
Let a nigga hold five 'til my grinder click
I done had all life to think about this
All y'all judging, handful of Bics
I done passed out twice and I ain't been hit
Shit I might be blessed let me right this left
Navigate this ride, I really don't need an apartment
Line like who bought the fifth
Hoop out the lobes and who had got kids
Let me get that little piece together
Pen start on my thesis sweater?
Make a way Head start on my niece's sweater
Money thrown on my chicken, man pizza whatever
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta leave you better
Grew up where the leaves are wetter
And I hope and I pray when you read this letter
That the seeds don't catch up to your knees already
'Cause all my dogs good
They running, they running don't run out the clock
They living in a falsehood for damn way too long, man, check out the stock
But that's cool, y'all can keep on sipping out this narcissistic pool
And I'ma sit outside that shit just like the old dudes
Said I'ma sit outside that shit just like Kukoc do
And watch you jump hula hoops to satisfy your sudoku


Said baby girl I ain't no star, I just ain't from round here

My pilot told me I'll go far if I stay from round here

Hell I'm so good at missing calls, bitch I'm perfect this year

And I suggest you trace your scars if you get lost, my dear








Yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in


Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby


All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!"
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh


Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby


Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself
I should kiss myself
I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though 
Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho 
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"


Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby





Woah woah
Woah woah huh
Woah woah huh


YSL pants with the zippersâyikes!
Met her this evenin', 'ready hit it, twice
Tag on your soul everybody got a price
Acid, acid, change yo' life
Bape if she hip, Saint Laurent if she bougie
I'm faded like Boosie
She call me Meechy over, I slide in that coochie
Nosedive in that coochie
My dick is big, it should be wearin' a Coogi
Iâm in Nice of France
Tie-dyed my lifestyle
Even bleached the pants
Next week Japan
Thom Browne bubble lens, eyes need the tint
Flatbush, Brooklyn, from the County of Kings
Run up on me like I'm some hippie nigga
And die under the knife, Joan Rivers
Ooh, damn, that punchline delivers
Hold up wait a minute, moment of silence
Hm, fuck it
Let's get back to wylin'
Blood on your Timbs, Shoot Shoot
Blood at your limbs, tuh tuh
Slugs hit your rims
Ambidextrous, I shoot with two hands
Even got blood on your friends
I think I just flooded the Benz
Damn it, baby, Meechy's at it again
M-M-Murder, murder, murder
Capital M with two gats in my hand


Everyday a nigga wake up, got to blaze a little chronic
Thank the universe, a blessing, new day, a new dollar
Middle finger to my niggas and my bitches two times
Representing for my niggas in the hood it's no ceiling
Sellin', trappin' like a villain, cold
Should've made a killing, go
Finger played with it, yo
Nigga stay with it
Hate a nigga, fade him quicker now
Numb dum diddy dum I, I, I, I, I
High like the sun
Fetch a frequency, this ain't shit to me
She said she got a friend, then let my nigga beat
Meech roll 'em, bust 'em, cannons, wooh
Spliff long looking like a Manson
I'm on acid feeling like the Hamptons
She feeling freaky beat the pussy like a champion
Young nigga but I'm still O.G
Supreme Team like 1993
Triple 6 on my coffin, I dance with the devil
Came back with a vengeance, Christ off the hinges
I'm nice with the spit kid, twice as much vicious
Psycho-active, I'm on a mission
Electric Kool-Ade
Make your decision
You want it, I get you
These niggas ain't right, they can't write they own shit
But they smile in your face, and they claim they the shit
But to me a disgrace
Trying to keep steps ahead like we running a race
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make
Free my niggas lawd, made it right today
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make


Not a thug but niggas know how I keep mine
Call her up or quick to throw up the peace sign
Throw that pussy, let me hit it
Girl, I got to get it
Saying she got a feeling, she let a young nigga hit it
Back and forth cause we smoke them seven grams
Real boss shit I donât expect you to understand
My performance, dreams at 14
Now I hear them calling two to their seats
Wonât slip away this is serious business
Voidin the mischief while spending these Benjamins
Surrender potential pussy to me
Brought to you by the ungrateful police
Conscious keep telling me, beautiful melody
Will exhibit if I trip on the L.S.D
Nah, window for money and dro
Some people think I spend money for show
Spending show money
Flip like aerobics
Components will kill my opponents
I sit on my throne, it's enormous
Composed with the chorus
My karma is good, dog, and don't need supportin'
My bitch is so gorgeous, I cannot afford
To spend time with her when chasin' these whores
Money, keep countin'
She strip like Lance Mountains
My passport is packed
How I travel, astoundin' 
"Thug Waffle"âdid that
Now we comin' back for the killer contract
Pull up on your pampers
Three man army
Address the bitch niggas in a song, call it Palm Trees
Not a fan of you if you ain't ever hug my moms, b
Not a fan of niggas that be talkin' where I'm gon' be
Talk a lot of mess, leave you niggas out of pocket
Don't talkin' to me less you talkin' bout a profit


Universe a blessing, a new day a new dollar
Tag on your soul, everybody got a price
Acid, acid change yo' life







Ronny J, listen up


I'm a gook!
If I told you that I wasn't then
A nigga wouldn't be telling you the truth
Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga that ain't nothing new
Yeah I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too
Yeah I'm a gook, looking like that nigga Buu
Cut me off, I'm at the booth
Bitch, uh!


Jabbie told me we gon blow like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!


Loose, with a screw, loose from the Tre Deuce, smoking boof
Bitch, I always knew, that I was a gook
But how this gook, ended up surpassing you?
Why you looking confused?
Made a hard album so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you threatz, ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because thatâs on the set
Fucking with me I will put you to rest
Lie and youâll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!


Jabbie told me we gon blow up like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!


From the days, I've seen thus far
People tell me that I gook on the daily
One day, I'm gon' be a star
I don't give a fuck if you're gonna hate me
New chains and brand new cars
People tell me that it's all gonna change me
But for now, my mind's on Mars
'Cause you know a nigga gook on the daily






Yeah
First day, first day, first day


Now that they fucked up
I got myâkeys,âtook my cuffsâoff
Skin like my leather, it's tough,âuh
Wish a bitch would call my bluff
I got some bread,âbutâit'sânever enough
All ofâthese demons andâno one to trust
Die for my freedom, they takin' from us
All of my issues, I never discussed
All of my niggas like Snow on tha Bluff
I got some time that I'll never get back
I give no fuck like I'm showing my track
I turn it off when they playing your track
You just as bitch if you fuck with a rat
I got some mouths that depending on me
Rappers ain't who they pretending to be
Somebody's tryna get rid of me
They trading follows for dignity
Don't want me rich, then don't call me your homie
I don't like my money coming in slowly
Tryna buy mama a house
But these fuckin' crackers still own me
I'm not no slave, I'm not no dog in no cage
I gave my masters to Sony
Bitch, it ain't sweet, and if you thinking you know me
I'm giving God all your glory
Do me a favor
Don't say you did me no favors
Don't be my friend and a hater
If it's from the heart
You was just doing your part
Don't bring it up again later
Fuck all your points
Fuck all your people you ever employed
Fuck all your beats
Fuck all your ears to the street
Fuck all you fake G's
Fuck the whole industry, bitch


Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no





MERLYN! Hopping out the vehicle, I feel like Batman
Hanging with directors, 'bout that action
So please don't stick-and-move in my direction
All I got to lose is my erection


I'm a Black man with a deadly weapon

I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been tripping on the steps, and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still, I'm suffocating


Carnival, my heart like a Supreme Phantom
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ayy, ayy
Daddy cracking redrum, blueprint for the pipeline
Going out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, tailored just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect, on my back, oh, man, they killing me


Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone

But I don't want nobody to see what's in it

Boys wanna play with my cell phone

But I don't want nobody to see what's in it



White burner, black burner, I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage so don't try to insinuate
Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant, when you do the most it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices


America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, with ghouls all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit, so Billy 'bout to air 'em out


Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone

But I don't want nobody to see what's in it

Boys wanna play with my cell phone

But I don't want nobody to see what's in it






Now, you pay up or else
What are you gonna do, kill me?
I'll teach you a lesson, you long-haired git!
I don't have to take that sort of talk anymore. Not from anybody


There ain't a reason I should fucking pretend
I rock my swagga on a hundred percent
But fuck love and respect
I'm vexed hungry and come to offend
And trust me I've done done it again
I mutter contempt another fuckree just under the breath
The dunce left from the club in a blubbering wreck
Mustn't forget that good things come to an end
But I'm the baddest thing you're touching me yeah


So allow me to reintroduce the recluse
Mind set to feed himself fumes and abuse
He was busy speaking the truth in his youth
Now elusive, rarely ever seen in the booth
Got 'em begging for the new shit
Live and exclusive
Until the mood lifts he's lighting his toothpick
Truth is dude spits tight as the noose grips
Loose lips two bit pricks couldn't do shit
If the shoe fits he's treading on extremities
Knows what the poison is just get him on the remedies
Settle on your enemy and fight until the death
Isn't drinking for the subtle hint of cider on the breath
I confess I'm depressed and I couldn't care less
'bout your rapper don swagger or your puffed out chest
What, next a tiny bit of shine at best
Then a lifetime spent on the side like the rest


There ain't a reason I should fucking pretend
I rock my swagga on a hundred percent
But fuck love and respect
I'm vexed hungry and come to offend
And trust me I've done done it again
I mutter contempt another fuckree just under the breath
The dunce left from the club in a blubbering wreck
Mustn't forget that good things come to an end
But I'm the baddest thing you're touching me yeah


I guess you lesser breddas better button it
He was simply waiting for the game to catch him up a bit
Nothing did
Fresh off the mothership desperate to double dip
Under his fingers to rest on his gums and lips
The gutter kid, blessed with that other shit
And if you really wanna test me I come equipped
Yeah, I've got 'em vexed man they're trucking it
But those motherfuckers don't know who the fuck they're fucking with
So let me give 'em a clue
It's that rap-cat longer than a didgeridoo
Billin' a zoot, walking in and filling his boots
Of your wives, your girlfriends and mistresses too
Shit happens that didn't approve
Looked a little confused deadsitted the rou
But I couldn't give a flying fuck sitting consumed
The bitterest fumes I'm back bitch isn't it true


There ain't a reason I should fucking pretend
I rock my swagga on a hundred percent
But fuck love and respect
I'm vexed hungry and come to offend
And trust me I've done done it again
I mutter contempt another fuckree just under the breath
The dunce left from the club in a blubbering wreck
Mustn't forget that good things come to an end
But I'm the baddest thing you're touching me yeah





I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good


I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah


Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you


I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah


The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight


C'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love 
I'm passive aggressive 

I like when we hold hands

See I get jealous 
And if I see that nigga 
I just might kill him, haha 

Love, love, love



I'm in love 


I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah


"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"





Bunches and bunches, punches is thrown until youâre frontless
Oodles and oodles, bang bullets at suckers' noodles
Last album? Voodoo! Proved that we was fuckin' brutal
Iâm talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo, baby shit, just basic boo boo
Iâm Shaka Zulu, Mansa Musa, my money's beaucoup
My beats is banginâ, fuck what you rappin, who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got and Run The Jewels you


You itsy bitsy, furry frightened and frickin' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for winter swimming
Look at these kiddies, Mike, I'mma rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work; do the deed and then dashâditch 'em
I'd lend a hand but it's stuck in a fist and gun position
We run a brand where destruction's the number one commitment
Itâs all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear into smoke like we're fucking magicians


No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers

You punks is pussy, proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake âem, DDT âem in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my coliseum



I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluation
I'm a phallus, a Johnson, a Jimmy sprayin' faces
Any cow that is sacred will get defaced
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced, face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you're like, "Mellow out, man, just relax
It's really not that complicated"
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just insane as you explain-ed
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is deranged


This Run The Jewels is: murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it to lose it, junkies simply abuse it
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoff' and I'm kushin', coughin'
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin', waitin'
I give a fuck if I'm late, tell Satan be patient
But I ain't here for durations, I'm just taking vacations
And tell him fuck him, I never loved him and salutations





Hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Bitch, I'm a bad man, fuck with the Badmon 
Bitch, I'm a bad man, fuck with the Badmon
Hmmm


I'm lit, you litter
Not more lit, man, something we get rid of
And I never been a swimmer, so how'd this little nigga
Made his way through a motherfucking mainstream river?
All on my lonely, I'm a lone shark, bitch
Better have my money, she can keep the heart if not
Then I'm coming to the spot to rip the bones apart
But you won't believe my mark with the Bonaparte
And they can never question my pen
That's a motherfucking death sentence, my friend 
With the pen for real, the bars of steel
Yeah, show me which one of y'all are for real
All you niggas just charm us up
And your lady friend gonna rip my garments up
Hook around and get 'em unpopular
With the clothes on every floor like a department store
Oh Lord, coming for the highest powers
On God, got respect for my rasta man
Them on Jah, a big fat chocolate bar
That's on the law, the devil is a lie
And I don't fuck with the law
That law, gotta keep it gold
Putting on for my city, putting on for my bro
I make one false move, I'm gon' ram it up
Joey Bad and Glass Animals, and let's go


Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt


Come take a walk through my mental
Let's talk, what interest you?
I tell you all the essentials
Just please don't be judgemental
And don't expect, just continue
To accept what I give you
Trust is not detrimental
Just what you been exempt to
Okay, let us begin
Strolling down memory lane
Siphon right by that gym
I've been straight flowing for days
Scraping pennies for change
Of living in better way
The sky's been blue a lot
But my mood's been hella grey
I got this heater today
Can't wait to let the bitch go
I got some problems, my man
That I can't tell one soul
So please just watch what you say
I be that baddest mofo
I tell her, lose control
I'm 'bout to lose control


Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt


Now I'm feeling all messed up
Spinning out, I'm drinking through this cup
Tripping out, I'm sitting on the cusp
But something I don't think I'm the one, I'm on fire
Lose control, 'bout to go insane
'Bout to lose my mind playin' this old game
I'm so sick and tired of the crazy law
And this crazy place, but I don't wanna give it to you
Lose control, where you go insane
And you lose your mind playin' your game 
And you're sick and tired of the crazy law
And this crazy place, I don't wanna give it to you


That man is a bad man, so don't you try
That man is a bad man, that man is a bad man, so don't you try
That man is a bad man, Badmon is a bad man, so don't you try
That man is a bad man, Badmon is a bad man
Yeah!





Back then you and I was broke
All we used to do was fuck and smoke
Massage my back while I roll
That's why everything a nigga did was dope
That's why I got down for a dose
That's why you and I so close
Don't you see we gotta do the most
All them haters we gon' make a toast
Till I die I'm Ph but you make me feel some way
Speechless don't know what to say
Grab my dick lets party babe
Grab the weed and party faze
Fuck no we will not behave
To your rules I'm not a slave
Don't you trip I got this babe


Girl you know I really like your features
I might go down by the bleachers
Just tell me if you see any teachers
Girl I know your father a preacher
And later this ship might eat ya
But I do anything to get ya
When you cross my mind i miss ya
I gotta have you in my picture


Baby you and I should
Honey we should chill sometime
Baby you and I should

Everything that I do

Babygirl I got you

Baby you and I should
Maybe we can chill sometime
Everything that I do
Babygirl I got you

Oh no I cannot believe it
Nah that's not Azizi you must've mistake him for breezy
Talking like this shit is easy
Nah this shit is greasy just have Stevie b do a meme
But this shit ain't like whats on TV
Yeah ain't nothing here geechy unless you like 2 people screaming
Please, let out your semen don't let out your demons unless you're prepared for the sequence
Cause love is relentless it kills with no question
It could give a shit bout your defense
You best count your blessings not worry 'bout mentions
You just buildin' up your tension
I'm here to prevent it and lend you my pennies and then take yo ass out to Denny's
Go sip some henny, fuck if she let me, give you a night to remember


Baby you and I should
Honey we should chill sometime
Baby you and I should
Baby we should chill sometime
Everything that I do
I do with you on my mind
Babygirl I got you
God damn you so fine
Baby you and I should





I been scheming for a long time

Dreaming on my own cloud

My life is a movie now

In my me time I spend my free time overseas
Brotherhood of traveling pants, I'm rocking foreign jeans
I don't speak about my life, my life it speak for me
If you think you got it figured out, you only got a peak
Wes Anderson, zoom, hit my close up, I'm a star
Moved to Hollywood and I ain't even have a car
I'm 'bout working smart, I am not 'bout working hard
I can tell you stories but the real thing more bizarre


Lights, camera, action
Are you ready for the main attraction?
Suicide doors, it's tragic
Take a picture, what you here for? It'll last you


I been scheming for a long time
Now they know whats up
I was screaming from my home town
I don't give a fuck
Dreaming on my own cloud
I can't pass the blunt
My life is a movie now
I can't make this up


Movie started playing soon as I came out the womb
You could ask my parents, they knew, they was in the room
Lights, camera, action till the day I got a tomb
Till then I'm driving foreign whips, now tell me, what's the move?
Ten-thousand people in the crowd goin' crazy
I was being nice but now I'm way too lazy
To try to give a fuck now unless you finna pay me
I'm a fuckin' brat, shout out everyone who made me


Lights, camera, action
Are you ready for the main attraction?
Suicide doors, it's tragic
Take a picture, what you here for? It'll last you

You ain't seen no one like me since
Lauryn Hill back in the '90s, bitch
Feeling myself, yeah, I might be, bitch
Got an old soul and you know that
Bet the olders make way for the '90s kid 
Please don't kill my high, I been
Work nonstop, never tired, no
That girl is on fire, you know
Always stay bringin' them vibes, you know

Can't know what he be meddlin' through
I'm paid now and I got shit to lose
Look at where we are, who would've guessed, who knew?
I did, that's for sure
I kicked down the doors
They tryna not let me get in
Fuck that, I crashed the party
Fuck that, I am the party
Don't get me started
I am a one-woman army
I am the force that we speak of
What's a wave to a tsunami?
True, my drip enormous
Your tap running out, talk about awkward 
My thoughts hella distorted
But got my foresight, it was moving forward


This is for the now
This is for the now

Feel the bass, man

Watch yourself, be cool, don't stress
Get back to you when I can, messages on read
Ain't new to this shit, I been blessed
No love, you can get the drama instead
Oi, you can get the drama instead
All this smoke to your head
You can get your whole career dead
Can't get my foot off your neck
Go get a bag and invest

Looking like a bulletproof vest

Feel the bass, man

Yeah, as a shorty, playing in the front yard of the crib
Fell down, and I bumped my head
Somebody helped me up and asked me if I bumped my head
I said, "Yeah"
So then they said, "Oh, so that mean we gon', you gon' switch it on 'em?"
I said' "Yeah, Flipmode, Flipmode is the greatest"
Knowing as a shorty, I was always told
That if I ain't gon' be part of the greatest

Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool
Oh, now you a man, ho?
I don't need that stress, that stress
I'm a boss in a fucking dress
Nigga, stay in line


Hype shit, never hype bitch
Know now that you're dealing with a crisis
Never been nice, never been nice nigga
I'm a thrift store kid, real fly, nigga
Haven't seen a show 'til you see me live, nigga
At 23 sold dreams to my side nigga
See God when you look me in my eyes, nigga
Learnt from 'Ye then went and touched the sky nigga
15 when I wrote "Will To Survive," nigga
Fast-forward seven years, "Low Tides," nigga
Stayed in my own lane, never side tracked
I serve-serve, lemme prep it, lemme dice that
You likkle rodents went and fell into my mice trap
And you can send a diss, I will never write back
Never lack, still whippin' main road nigga
Man they shoulda never let me discover the mic


Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool 
Oh, now you a man, ho?
I don't need that stress, that stress
I'm a boss in a fucking dress
Nigga, stay in line


Got in a pattern, followed the rhythm
I disregarded all opinions and continued my mission
Unapologetically I be bossin' it, getting better with age
Got it back, never lost it, my legacy remains
Rejected the dotted line but not the pen
Invested in myself, that was money well spent
Came home, mummy burning incense
'Member tryna think of ways to help contribute to the rent
Now the room's upstate, top suite penthouse
Views where there's no family or friends
What life do I want? Know I gotta choose 'fore it's too late
Well I guess it all depends, uh
I was running with Toby and them
Never looked back once I discovered the pen
Dedicated it all to the art
Who would've known it would be this from the start?


Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool 
Oh, now you a man, ho?
I don't need that stress, that stress
I'm a boss in a fucking dress
Nigga, stay in line


Nigga, stay in line
Stop fucking with my heart





Yuh, ayo
Ayo


I put the feline in my hair, looking like a cheetah pet
And you know they getting green if a flower on they neck
If a flower on they neck hit Clancy on the text
I ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?
I ain't gassin' niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand
Passionfruit in D.R., had me dripping in the sand
New nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands
Sticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams
They was playing at the Gramm's, one nom ain't enough
I'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again, yuh
Golf boys, it's them golf boys
In that 12 seater wings looking like a hawk boy
Getting to the paper better re-up on the chalkboard
Because the student turned into the teacher
Don't talk boy, class in session
1 through 5, I'm a 7
I'm a god nigga ask your reverend
And that crib in Bel-Air is heaven
Hot-coco outta chinas nigga pass the beverage, yuh
Comme Des on that hombre
Haters with the long face
New whip is Pirelli tired like a long day
Big dollars, the scent Prada
Skinny nigga also big poppa, women they adore me
If you see me out in public, no pictures don't record me
I don't really fuck with y'all niggas, selfish at the orgy, uh


Bitch
One take
Yuh





You know what I mean?
Like I told the nigga, I'm like, "Yo, you know myâbody,âmy nigga, ha
Iâdon't know what you talkin' 'bout
Butâyou know how I get down, baby
Don't be tryna talk crazy over here"


I got the whole world on my hands now
Attitude, fuck it, like I'm caught with my pants down
You pussy, and I always been the dawg
Most of the game are rookies, you know that we came to ball
Sooner you bring it to me, the sooner we ship it off
Hennessy and bad decisions, makin' millions off a song
With this bad lotto , my motto, drive and swerve potholes
Numbers don't lie when on my side, capo


I got an energy problem, no I got an enemy problem
No I got a Hennessy problem, paranoiaâs gettinâ me probably
Opposite of kamikaze, papi your shit never droppinâ, stop it
Tight body, nothing sloppy but her toppy, zombie gang, gang gang
Body rotten
Gucci sweats while casket shopping
Iâm possessed, the acid dropper
Never lying Booâ
Iâm designed to rhyme, the grimy moves is what Iâm inclined to do
Iâm sorry silly rhymers your highness
Donât need no kind of boost
This is highly ignitable, riot inciting
Frying my mind, body with chemicals
Why try?
Itâs all in your mind, red eye flights, Iâm going in raw
Lets roll the dice roll the dice
Kill you on cam, flick
Take your life for likes, Iâm trife, Iâm quite nice
Precise with knife, slice and dice
Inhale, exhale, close one eye, then snipe
Beware, this here is the tales of the dark side
Nobody gets out of alive
Ask why, Satan cried when I was baptized
All I got is my balls, my word, my pride
Her head fire
Ghost Rider, just Meech no help, no writer no sire
Pussy boy eat fire, Flatbush, east sider


I got the whole world on my hands now
Attitude, fuck it, like I'm caught with my pants down
You pussy, and I always been the dawg
Most of the game are rookies, you know that we came to ball
Sooner you bring it to me, the sooner we ship it off
Hennessy and bad decisions, makin' millions off a song
With this bad lotto, my motto, drive and swerve potholes
Numbers don't lie when on my side, capo


Yeah
Dirty as Jersey, no disrespect to Reggie the Noble
Repeatedly hittin' your whip until it's been totaled
Please, lady, no photos, I'm hardly sober
My omens have only told me to focus on every quote
And expose every single soul with the motives of takin' over this globe
Takin' over the road, on the dough with my bros
I'm bowling with pins of woes, more than convinced I'm old
Wisdom infinite fold, my window is tinted, closed
These niggas is gimmicks, so I hit 'em like Riddick Bowe
I'm driven to pay the toll, you niggas is paper plush
You fuckin' with angel dust , we can't be fucked with
It's nothin' to niggas, no discussion, I crushed 'em
Sweet as custard, apply the pressure, the messier, the dossier
Closure when the Yankees play they closers 
Can't you see me? 3D, Tesla memory
Here's the melody, eat your shit, human centipede


I got the whole world on my hands now 
Attitude, fuck it, like I'm caught with my pants down 
You pussy, and I always been the dawg
Most of the game are rookies, you know that we came to ball
Sooner you bring it to me, the sooner we ship it off
Hennessy and bad decisions, makin' millions off a song
With this bad lotto, my motto, drive and swerve potholes
Numbers don't lie when on my side, capo 


See I learned a new word today, nigga
Triskaidekaphobia
An extreme superstition regarding the number thirteen
That's why a nigga don't be havin' thirteenth floor on theâanyway
Most project buildings don't really get past thirteenth floor anyway, so it don't really matter
What's poppin', blood? You good, you good?
You click the thirteenth floor for me?
Ayo, thirteenth floor
Alright, eleventh floor

Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week 
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me? Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately

It won't hold me down no more


Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her

Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is 
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius 
Sin everyday, someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees

Always had a dream of stuntin', it ain't nothing unless you runnin' shit 
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan

Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance
Bald

Been there, done that, done seen it
Not my girl but I fuck her like she is
They be fucking up my lyrics on Genius
And these pussy ass critics repeat it
Been the same since Even Stevens
Y'all niggas switch like the seasons 
Yâall lives ainât got no meanin' 
And them deals ainât got no freedom
I can't just loop it and leave it
Gotta smack it up, rip it up, and eat it 
You can't feed your kid 'cause you spent that shit on your car 
Tape my hands, Iâm going over squares' heads like a VCR 
Bald





The Lord will make a way
The Lord will make a way
The Lord will make a way
The Lord will make a way


Uh, uh, look
Uh, no, I don't believe him
Uh, but know that I've been grieving
Know that I've been holding out, hoping to receive him
I've been holding out for G but he was nowhere to be seen
When I was bleeding
Cousin with the choking and the wheezing
But still he dream of smoking potent in the evening
This is only for the heathens
Hold until the souls who need redeeming from the demons
Still ain't folded when it's freezing
There ain't no-one to believe in, I'm on that man side
Damn right, doing it myself from a landslide
Stand by, didn't need no help from no damn guy
Man by, I've been making waves all my damn life
Planned my step to the letter and I stand by it
Try it, we ain't holding back if it backfires
Lax, not the ones who carry crack 'til their back tired
Thought they'd make a mil' 'til it transpired
I ain't like them damn liars
Uh, I'm saying I ain't like them damn liars


Trust, told him I ain't like them damn liars
So keep your mouth closed shut
Eyes wide open when that doubt rose up
'Cause if that drought shows nothing but the clouds hold
Nothing but the sound, I'll be running 'til the ground open up
'Cause the best don't change, clinging to that whole one
My mother said, "There's no love until you show some"
So I showed love and got nothing, now there's no-one
You wonder why I couldn't keep in tow, son?
I wonder why my dad didn't want me, ex didn't need me
Half of them left and the rest finna breeze me
It's blessed 'til I second guess, rest 'til it freeze me
There's nothing to believe in, believe me


The Lord will make a way
And when I get in trouble
The Lord will make a way
I have the Lord by my side
The Lord will make a way
And whenever I need him
The Lord will make a way


Little bit of life after death
Scatter my ashes when it's my time for rest
With the lines I'm obsessed, rhymes I possess
Can't deny, seen the biggest guys cry to confess in a breath
Fresh death passing the chest, unimpressed with the sess
Left scars in the flesh, he's the best, worst-kept sparring in jest
Saying, "Star never bar too far from the nest"
So I never left and never thought about doing so
I to-and-fro from that prime time to a home
You see, I'm doing those nights I should've known better
Like whatever, still my breddas say I'm too involved
But who would know what the family first is?
'Til you dream, see three family hearses
Worst is, wanted me to speak at the service
So I penned a couple bars, didn't need to rehearse this


The Lord will make a way
And when I get in trouble
The Lord will make a way
I have the Lord by my side
The Lord will make a way
And whenever I need him
The Lord will make a way





A is for the apple, take a bite and spit it out
B is for bodega, eatin' on your mama couch
Low bazooka with a Puerto-Rican chula
Says she workin' in the city and she gettin' moolah
C is for the crib, the cats that call you catch
CBGB's babies sneakin' blondie through the back
D is for the downtown kids that's hittin' licks
Skater boys in the park tryna fuck some white chicks
E is for the East Side, Ruff Ryder Ride or Die
Motorbikes from every side
Flyin' down the FDR, breakin' Dutches in the car
G is for the ghetto girl and Rainbow clothes
Baby hairs and well done toes, single mothers carry those
Bummy sneakers, what are those? Get in goin', golden go
Hunts Point got the hottest hoes, inner city, tragic woes
Splattered streets, the bloody holes, shorty dancin' on the pole
Casually it's casual b, bloody hands with the anatomy
Jehovah witness at your door, actin' like nobody home
TV off, all alone, kick the door in, mama Jonesin' on the phone
Bata and a doobie on, waiting on her tax return
Low lives lightin' Ls, pourin' down for ones they love
Tompkins Square, lower east, Delancey for the deli meats
You don't come to C or D
I'm in Manhattan like I'm Woody Allen
Jewish, Puerto-Rican and a little bit Italian
Sittin' on the steps outside the Natural History
New York fuckin' City and I love the history
Everything a meltin' pot, every block is fuckin' hot
83rd the train stop, open cases, old as shorty braces
Pick you up on warrant squad, now they runnin' faces
Pick you up by the park, we was voguing by the pier
Paris burnin', full of Queens, hit the Village every year
Rollin' now to the rave, Village Voice, six page
I was diving off the stage, going now, every day
Stickball in the summer, you know it's summertime
Schomburg, eatin' soul food, singin' Doo-Wop every night
Subway trains goin' by, squad is sittin' St. Marks
Shootin' up in Tompkins park, know it's dirty after dark
Tunnels takin' turns, playin' tag on the curb
Touchin' on some titties, takin' change out your purse
Undercover agents I can spot them all away
Yo, I hate the fuckin' cops, NYPD get away
Underground are MTA, close my eyes and ride the train
Back and forth on everyday, anywhere, anyway
Xerox copied Zines stapled onto poser trees
Got a show, come and see, New York is the place to be
Here you go and live your dreams
Livin' in the city you can't be a xenophobe
This the melting pot, and the soup is never cold
Young lords, young lords, they live inside of me
I got a problem B, with white supremacy
Rollin' through my zipcode, One double zero two nine
ABC's of New York, and I'll be doing fine







Stopper, to every DJ, dem haffi talk to me proper

Yeah, used to wanna be a superhero
Flyin' round with a cape catchin' bad guys
Now my head underwater
But I ain't in the shower and I ain't gettin' baptized 
To the good and the bad times 
All the cuts, broken bones, and the black eyes 
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y'all canât tell me nuttin' no more
Came from the basement under that floor 
You don't come close, you don't even know I'm the G.O.A.T
You donât need to know how I go
'Cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post
Yeah, my girl too clutch to choke 
And I ain't callin' it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
While I keep talkin' that shit, it's like this  
Liquor still in my cup 
Get faded when I wake up 
'Cause everything is too much 
So what? 


Woke up this mornin' with a bright idea 
Maybe I can exist forever right here 
Yeah 
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm


Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel


Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip 
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss 
Never put a limit on the high stakes 
Try to pull my card, tell them, "Go Fish" 
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy from myâ
Yeah, I don't say nuttin' that I don't know
Jumpin' out the womb wearin' Polo
Everybody wanna jump in, but I'm old school
Lone wolf, take 'em on solo, yeah
I don't need nobody 
I don't need to be nobody 
I'm just doin' my thing
Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side 
I'm pullin' up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride 
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect 
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet 
Feelin' like they forget, I let it slide, this time
Like twenty-five years I've been high and no less 
Shit, I know, I don't guess
Rather glow, I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest


Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel

Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Fallin' in deep
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear





From Venus to Mars back to Earth
Back to the HBO satellite
It's showtime, nigga
King Geedorah on the boards 
MF DOOM, and I am Mister Fantastik
Expeditiously I be on my grizzly
Feds try to creep me somehow always miss me
Mister Fantastik put the busy in the bee
Rock from the bottom straight to the tizzy
Who is he? He need to get out more
Or either get outta here like some dang outlaw
Standing like Lurch, no herb in the record bin
Called him for a random search from curbside checkin' in
It's on nigga, on and cracking
Like Digg'em, lips be smacking
Running off at the mouth steady talkin' 'bout us
On some shit they overheard but enough is enough
Yeah, It's neither here nor there, black
Warfare in your ear, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
What's that? You're hearing things! Tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Be wearing your thinking hat


No matter how hard they try
They can't stop us now
We got King Geedorah on the boards
With that golden sound
 
They don't know how we get down
When we're out out of town 

So, when you see us in the streets
Don't be fuckin' around



A hundred things on the re-up, of course I'm living fat
My Mercedes outside, nigga, where yours at?
Top down on a good day, Decatur, out on Wood Way
Got cats thinking should I stay, fuck what the hood say
Niggas wanna rob me now
Bitches wanna slob me now
Hoes didn't holla last year feel sorry now
Practice jumpshot, Reggie Mill', Robert Horry now
The nigga that you with played like Atari now
Lyrically unorthodox, I flow continuous
Never on a straight path, I'm known to bend a twist
Put it down from the suburbs to the tenement
You bet against me but wanna wonder where your money went
I get the cash, take niggas out like trash
Known to stack a mean stash, they used to call me pure math
Back in the days, all I did was stay paid
But as they say in the South, bitch; "Gimme some head"
Excuse me, Misterâdo she got a sister?
Who he not to kiss her? Trueâshe do got a blister
Now the movie plot twists like a Twizzler
If I needed my meat burned I'd go to Sizzler
Getting paid like a biker with the best crank
Spray it like a high-ranked sniper in the West Bank
Type to just blank and don't show much pity
When I'm in the city, I always keep a dutch with me
Touch her titty 'til she ask me where the trees is at
Or tell me don't squeeze that, rats wanna tease a cat
Let the dog beg, wait up, who talking?
DOOM with the hog leg straight up New Yorkin'


No matter how hard they try
They can't stop us now

We got King Geedorah on the boards
With that golden sound

They don't know how we get down
When we're out out of town

So, when you see us in the streetsâ





Interviewer: Is it hard to be fresh if you don't have money or can you still pull it off?
Gucci: See when I ain't had no money I still had sauce. So if you don't got no sauce, then, you lost. But you can also get lost in the sauce


Takin' off, liftin' off, like I'm shootin' straight for Mars
Sorry Ma, I've been gone, haven't been home in like months
Now I'm off, now I'm off, sipping dope like I'm a fiend
I been drunk, I been drunk, but girl please don't fix me


Wanna own me, control me, but it cannot hold me
I've been inside my mind, been wasting time all by my lonely
Off the handle, drinking Jack, I shoulda changed my name to Daniel
Wax is burning like a candle but my homie owes me

Told 'em that the drink was empty, they already got more
They got more and all I am is happy now

Mind, you with these wishes, that's how I'm driven, now I'm
Off, I'm working harder, back where I started, I've been
Gone, I've been lost, I'm surely parted and my


Patience growin' thin, there ain't nowhere left to hide
I need this more than anything I'm crashin' right beside the tide
My brother, my family, they all just stay alive
Drinkin' out the bottle now I'm roamin' on this high


In it, in it, in it, listen, really fuckin' listen
I ain't stop and say it, trippin', gettin' what I'm gettin'
Mama love me so you know I'm gonna make her proud
And there ain't no way that you're gonna stop me now


So who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who can stop me now?


I been here, I been really here

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?


Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
"Please come back to Rome," you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
âPlease pick up the phone, pick up the phone!â
I said: âDon't embarrass me,â instead of âBe mineâ
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize


I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh


I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; "What ifâ"
"You over my shit?"


I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh


And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
"You did what with who?"
What good is a mÃ©nage Ã  trois when you have a soulmate?
"You risked that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay


I'm never gonna treat you like I should





Oh so lousy
Kitty kill the mousy
Too damn cloudy
Trapped in his house
He never could arouse me
Tooâdamnâsaucy
Lean on me
Nowâhe drowsy
Drugs without me
Oh we couldn'tâbe
Please forgive me
I'm too bossy
Hit the party
Paparazzi all on me
Plane crash
Kamikaze
Off my lips, to microphone
Welcome to the Zebra zone
To the speakers to your dome
Never have to be alone
At the function or at home
Flow equipped, it's read' to go
All aboard this rodeo
Saddle up, enjoy the show
Hope that you'll be back for more
What it do though?
Hit it real slow
Would you like that?
What you want more?
Give it to you good
Hit it 'till you blow
Amateur or pro?
I do it like a hoe
One bad bitch
But you already know


When it all goes down and you ain't around
They all love you when you're dead and you're six under ground
When it all goes down and you ain't around
They all love you when you're dead and it all goes down
Do you struggle with it, often cuddle with it?
Does it ever keep you up at night, at night?
Do you wake up with it, wishing you could quit it?
But it's always right on your mind, on sight? 


Let me real good, yeah, uh huh
Fuck you all night, yeah, alright
What that shit do, what you into?
What it taste like, do that shit bite?
Love you real good, yeah, uh huh
Fuck you all night, yeah alright
Whole life in in the shade is a goddamn shame
Self-made, well-paid, well look what I became
Bad man pon di beat
Underdog, I'm a beast
Top Katz in sheets
Like a vegan got that the greens
You don't know why I be, you don't see it how I see it
You don't trust and believe it
You don't trust and believe it


All and nothing, tell me something
I'm the only one you're fucking, only one you're giving loving
Please don't share it, oh I love it
Cross my heart, hope to die
When I leave you, please don't cry
All my life and all my stripes
Girl, I give you so much life


When it all goes down and you ain't around
They all love you when you're dead and you're six under ground
When it all goes down and you ain't around
They all love you when you're dead and it all goes down
Do you struggle with it, often cuddle with it?
Does it ever keep you up at night, at night?
Do you wake up with it, wishing you could quit it?
But it's always right on your mind, on sight?





Hold on
I've been gone too long, I think it's time I get back

Man, they love me in the hood

I've been callin' on my niggas just to lift up
Think I want me a new Lamb', the doors
Lift up, lift up, lift up, lift up

Swear that I work the hardest
Most of y'all dudes are garbage
I'm a starving artist
I'm so sorry, darlin'
Don't mean to be rude
Stepping on your shoes

Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket


Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent


My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air





Love
Love


Just let go of sorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
'Cause tonight might be your last
So stay up till sunrise
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Leave it in the past


The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past


Breakdance and boogie, my love
This is 1971
I crave that brain and that flesh
Cups of tea and gums that bleed red
Say you wrap the plastic in white
Say you single all of my life
Blackest skin, disfigure my crimes
Credit cards and losing my mind
Piece-by-piece, they stitched me
Ain't no love, I'm still banging that Whitney
I can't cry for those who ain't with me
I can't pray so Lord, please forgive me, so
Pink like pussy, extra pushy
Hands up off me, she's so lovely
Fame and fortune, all those habits
Pink and white, them panties matching


I want you to stay forever
I want you to stay forever
I want you to stay forever
I want you to stay forever


The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past


Ring, ring, I'm tryna get my old thing back
But baby always wanna bring up shit from the past
Whoa-oh, our options are limitless
Putting in effort for the effort, it's too effortless
Woo, fuck checks, see the necklace
Gold hit her lips every time that I'm hitting it
Huh, I told her "Baby, I'm sorry
But if you think we got problems then baby, watch Maury"
Yeah, that's why you gotta smell the roses
We parted ways like she cheated with Moses
That's fucked up but a lot of things are
In Hollywood but I never see stars
Do anything for ya, that's love
Go anywhere for ya, that's love
Might even kill for ya, that's love
And if you're still tripping, that's drugs


Just let go of sorrow
Like there's no tomorrow
'Cause tonight might be your last
So stay up till sunrise
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Leave it in the past


The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past


Extra white, she's so extra white
My appetite, I lost appetite
It's paradise, we in paradise
So extra bright, it's so extra bright, so
I break the beat and I scratch it
She be like handsome, she be like dancing
Straight to my mattress, I was on smashing
I was on abra, she was cadabring
No free smoke when your bae is gone
Why love when it's free and it does no harm?
New phone, who's this? And my life's on charge
Two shows, pay rent, get a girl, get a job
Belly of the beast, when I walk in the streets
All I see is fake love, insecurities
Two months, seven days, oh, when you first came
Walked in, Off-White, all pink, okay


The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past
The past, the past, the past, the past
Leave it in the past





Yeah


You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice


Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like CÃ©line Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "Yes, I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most


You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just  want a  'nother  minute  wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? 
Never  super-  -ficial 
You gon'  know it  when it  hit you 
Get a  little  senti-  -mental when I'm off the juice 


Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit
I'm up thirty thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah


Ooh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh, I just wanna fly
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ha


You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just  want a  'nother  minute  wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? 
Never  super-  -ficial 
You gon'  know it  when it  hit you 
Get a  little  senti-  -mental when I'm off the juice 


You can love it
It just freaks me out





I was off the drugs, I was off the dranks, I was off the vibes
Gotânothin'âto hide, I'mâwith the squad, don't make meâthrow it up
She by my side, we bonafide, that shit is nice


It just don't look like this
If you living carefree then you probably don't look like us
Damn, nigga, let me cook right quick, on the beach
Couple niggas, we was cool and it's just 'bout dusk
Shawty never smoked kush like this
Some fire-ass music playin', grindin' on me
You know I had to push right back, reflex, respect
No suspect shit, came late
Goofy niggas missed the sunset
We ain't even give a fuck, got the Backwoods, though
Dropped those niggas, would've been upset
Only hit it two times 'cause I know that the paper's more of her speed she could fuck with
And I like that shit, she don't duck shit, but we was cool
And I said we didn't want smoke, so when the cops popped up
It was Pop Smoke, niggas proceeded to get on that fuck shit
Now I'm worried 'bout dyin' for speaking my mind, they keep on callin' it tough shit
I ain't do too much, just rough shit
Whole time it really is way too much shit
Playin' that shit right, it's some tough shit
And they know just which one to fuck with
It's just some shit we stuck with


We was off the drugs, we was off the dranks, we was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, will you ride or die?


Damn, nigga, let me breathe
Damn, nigga, let me cook
Damn, family, give me space
So quick to shoot, no Devin Book'
Can't even look me in my face
Can't play it straight, these niggas crooks
They player hate, I'm on my shit
Pulled me over 'bout my whip
Like, "How you get it?"
Bitch, I bought it, took my ticket for the tints
That might not seem too intense
But I ain't whip this in two months
The first day back, they on some shit
I can't let 'em steal my joy
See who my niggas is fuckin' with
Heard the whole squad at the beach
Guessin' we'll pull up and shit


We be off the drugs, we be off the dranks, we be off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, be with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, that shit is nice, damn
We was off the drugs, we was off the dranks, we was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, will you ride or die?


Damn, nigga, let me breathe
Damn, nigga, let me cook
Damn, nigga, give me space
Damn, nigga, let me breathe
Damn, nigga, let me cook
Damn, family, give me space
Quick to shoot, no Devin Book'
Can't even look me in my face





Yeah Hi-Tek
For who do we aspire to reflect our own people's death
For who's entertainment shallâweâsing of agony?âIn what hopes?
That the destroyers aspiringâto extinguish us will suddenly
Suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success?
The last imbecile to dream that dream is dead
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream
Armah, 2000 seasons


I'm not a human being getting on some spiritual shit
A spiritual being manifested as a human that's it
When I spit I spray thoughts that's representing my life
Yo I step into the spot leave niggas open like mics
Take on em on a tour
Explore psychologies of war
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen em before
Shorties come back raw
Straight out the c- 74
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by laws
The world is run by men who use laws for tools
But I come thru war tactics like Shaka Zulu
Mcs is soft like play-doh
I shape 'em
Smash em to pieces
Volunteer
Slaves crave the words I'm painting
The masterpieces
You hear em on the radio babbling
The truth is traveling with the word
I sent flying through the air like a javelin
Unraveling like a verdict
Pound it in your chest like a gavel in the highest court
In Bablyon, let's travel on
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live
Then from the get your ass was foul
And foul just is how you is
No excuses see, life's dilemnas are set up like a mirror
Just to show you all your faces
Now your understanding is clearer
You had your chance for evolution
You let it pass you by
That's why
I'm dissing wack mc's till the day that I die
Reflection getting you high
We stand our ground with the believers
The leaning tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza
No comparison
The way I flip it is embarassing
Tis the season
Ain't no caroling


All knowing
Flowing like spring water in the desert
Balling through the barren land
Where niggas take a stand, like castles made of sand
Free falling
For anything
Nothing but a plan to fail for they selves
No sense of delf, needed daily affirmations of self help
Yo it's right in front of yo grill stop looking everywhere else
Speaking of planning
Hustling and scheming
Looking for hookups
Took up too much time
Like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up
God bless the child that got his own shit
I got my team's
So the fiends now become opponents
They the opposition
Stronger from competition
Shining like a golden shower, your face I'm pissing in
Completing a genocide mission like
The Warren commission
Like fathers was supposed to be missing
While our sisters were supposed to be whoring
Save it for a rainy day, money is pouring
Under grey clouds, black butterflys still be soaring
Flying in frienldy skies
We classifying the highs
Blood be flowing in the streets like crimson tide in my eyes
The thai be having me drowsy
But I get mellow with the chronic
Intellectuals embarrased cause we discussing ebonics
I'm on a roll like sonic
In an age that the plague got bubonic proportions
Yo I call it reparations, but they call it extortion
Whatever
Just give me mine
But caution
You've been warned for the very last time
I'm not telling you again
So relay it to your crew
You gotta actually to do
Forget the drive in, driveby and drive through
You've got to
Get out the car
Humble yourself
Tilt your head back, and look at the stars
Shining over someplace very far, from where you standing
When the night is clear
You understanding just who put them there
What you know about the space you get lost in
Your peoples can't hear you in the distortion
The desert is absorption
And you sucked and you stuck off american freezing for like
2000 seasons
Upon your return from raping and crossbreeding
Your own people accuse you of deceiving and misleading
Causing mass confusion. Drug abusing
Now you all caught up in institutions
At this time you've got to break it down and be showing and proving
An A&R told me that I use too many catch phrases
True I'm trying to catch all my people in all different stages all
Different phases

It's like that y'all...





Yeah, move your body, inside the party
We 'bout to bring it to you kid like we never ever did
My nigga Al G in it, my nigga Shaheed in it
We got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it


A-yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow
I'ma make you move whether woman or fellow
Yo, I got the medals in the Warfield of respect
Like an ill porno make ya body get wet
Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow
Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow
I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will
MC's be ready to die cause I'ma kill
All your negative feelings standing on two feet
While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat
You know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen
If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion
Everybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion
I lay up in the piece on a incognotion


You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Now everybody here, you do the hop
You going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop
You gotta come back and do the hop
Yo, fuck the cops, you gotta come back and do the hop
Move till your body won't stop
You gotta do the hop, non-stop motion, non-stop
You gotta come back and do the, do the...


You see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson's
Get me vexed, I do like Left Eye, start an arson
Now that I got that out my system
Watch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson
I packs it in like Van Halen
I work for mine, you, you're freeloading like Kato Kaelin
I'm representing with my crew
Mess around, bite my rhymes, I'll beat that ass with my shoe
C'mon, you know I'm crazy nice
Brothers can't deal with the shorty named Phife
You must be mad in the head
I bust his ass and leave 'im blood clot for dead
Niggas sound like Das EFX
If it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth
You might as well do Megadeth
Y'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath
You's a corny motherfucker
You must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker
Y'all faggot asses don't want this
I pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas
Word is bond I am the baddest
And all you honeys out there, word is bond, you know my status
So come and pull your panties down
This ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
But don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends
Word is bond it don't stop
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop


You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Come on everybody, do the hop
Even if you cop, you gotta come back and do the hop
You move to the beat, you don't stop
You smoking jump rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top
You know we come back and do the hop
Shorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop
You gotta come back and do the hop
We never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop
This is how it is, we do the hop
You move to the beat, then come on everybody, don't...

Im lookin at the prototype of perfect/ she feelin me
Coupla drinks lil conversation ohh she feelin me
She said lets dip 2 yo spot and awww shhh feelin me
No talk no 4play ...now she really feelin me
Knee deep in that pretty pink....panther
She throwin it back and rollin like a belly dancer
Good lawd!! all questions answered
She told me that she was a Go-Getta im like go 4 it
Im thinkin 2 myself is this a dream or is it true
Am i the 1st or have many done this 2 u
Is it love or lust/and can i really trust
Will all these feelings fade/ as soon as we bust
But right now i feel the passion with every thrust
Were puttin on a show like its cameras
Worry about 2 ma 2ma
Share my nuts and let her have a ball





While my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' 'bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sittin' here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension
And I think I failed to mention
That I feel like I been runnin' outta seconds
Nobody gave a forewarning nor a preface
Followin' my dreams feel like followin' my death wish


She said she know just how that stress gets
When you hungry and you just tryna eat breakfast and nobody feel your message feel
Good enough to wake up and then fall back to sleep
It's a bad car to go get involved in like half the shit that I see
Plus I feel happier in my dreams, right
I spit that shit that give the feeling of the seaside
Hungover in Pitts
But with the flick of the wrist
Yo I can kick shit like this
I be as good as it gets
Even through all my vices
My inner being Rastafarian
Always one-hunnid three times you'll get Spartacus
What's with all you knock-offs, and self-conscious narcissists?
Said I'm an artist bitch, do this shit so artifice
In it for the hardships the nonsense of reapin' attention
Homie rolled up a blessing
We in a world with no exits
You gotta give me a second
Straighten up and get balanced
My homie flipped on a record
I beat it up ain't no challenge


I smoke that weed while my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sitting here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension
And I think I failed to mention
That I feel like I've been running outta seconds
Nobody gave a forewarning nor a preface
Followin' my dreams  feel like followin' my death wish


Ayo, reach and you slip a backpedal
I do my homework blazed and gets A's I'm mad mellow
I hear the sad fellows get they fix when I spit
Like that sun up in the sky you must protect or you get hit
Sometimes life is full of shit too many damn to-do lists
But yo I learned if you ain't coolin' you just being foolish
I used to think that I'ma die early, like mid-thirties
But fuck that I'ma rise early, and ride dirty
I reach the crucifix up to my lips and then I kiss it
I try to walk with God but got some holes up in my slippers
And so I keep on slippin'
Get tangled in the mischief
So in a nutshell I'm just a sinner named Christian
But still they keep me spinnin' when they drinkin' on they lonely
High rollin' like Jody, eyes open, got stolen by this music shit
And I don't think I'm coming back 
Everybody rockin' plaid we look like lumberjacks , ayo


I smoke that weed while my grandmother's scarf comforts me
But you look ugly
And I ain't ever trippin' bout the lack of company
Cause honestly I'm sittin' here alone quite comfortably
Depressed through this dimension
And I think I failed to mention
That I feel like I've been running outta seconds
Nobody gave a forewarning nor a preface
Followin' my dreams feel like followin' my death wish


Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Ayo, let it go
Damn, damn
Damn, yo
Damn





I'm at home smoking weed all day
Scratch marks on my escalade
And you gotta be the anecdote
I tattooed you right on my brain
Then why you wanna watch me drown?
Act up when I come around?
Flex up when we're making out?
Tell me how I just run you down
Those lips that I kissed today
Made up but in a foreign way
Stretch marks in my favorite place
I hate love but in a crazy way
Boy, you ain't gonna lay me down
Creased up in a paper crown
Peace'd up at your parents house
All day, all day


Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?


Small rips on your skinny jeans
Your tattoos, I wear it on my sleeve
Your password ends in twenty-three
Not safe, no way
You play dead like emergency
Your pants off, in your jewellery
We make up so when the choir sings
I miss us, miss we
Speaker blown on the driver's side
Say your tape gonna fly you high
But all I hear is some overdrive
All day, all day


Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?


So why-y-y can't you
Can't you lay down your arms for me?


Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?


I bet, I bet you are, mmhm
How am I supposed to believe that?
Why am I not surprised at all?
You know it's you
You're just saying that
Nah, that shit's not true
Rejjie





Always in trouble need love on the double spent cake
And a lifetime climbing to the level
Contract with the devil loopholed expiration date
On the side of good people always set the record straight
Round and round the piano keys meditate
Felt in the music need it now can't let it wait
It's not a secret everything is all out and exposed
It's going down like the water in the river flows
So it goes another day another story told
Stuck inside the puzzle searching still trying to get a hold
Forgotten souls got lost in the cold trying
To get freedom now they need 'em walking down to hope road
They said they hope so but it was a no go
Front row stage show well placed logo
Fancy lights and the cameras are on
But he don't care he's just there to sing another sad love song


Fade to black the soundtrack to another night
It's the music of the rain and the city lights
Feel no pain it makes the whole city bright
Without the sparkle or hype it's just another night
Fade to black the soundtrack to another night
It's the music of the rain and the city lights
Feel no pain it makes the whole city bright
Without the sparkle or hype it's just another night


And they all knew what it was from the first glance
No excuses should've planned in advance man
Documented on ProTools or Tascam
Struggles & hustles of an ordinary black man
Spin a record with two week life span
Can't find a good girl so we hug the mic stand
Not a lot of paper left in his right hand
Making enemies of folks he treated like fam
Stone cold, solid rock every point stop
What you lean on soon as the pressure drops
Ghetto hot, know the ledge and you'll hear the shot
But he'll never stop 'til his name's known on every block
Spread my wings fly away to the night beat
He's wide awake while the rest of the city sleeps
In these gritty streets, dudes creep with plenty heat
Pay it no mind and we grind losing plenty sleep


Yo, yo
Some play for keeps while you laid asleep
In the dark your worst nightmare waits for he
Anything discern, no dawn or despair
Air's crisp and calm I think a storm is near
And I'm watching lightning dance across the skyline
Usually miss it, rarely find time
To bask in blackness, hint of line shine
But in a jazz pub chilling, sippin' with fine wine
Hypnotize by the strum of the upright
Feel like lost souls got their eyes on me some nights
So keep my eyes wide and move cautious
Slip and find yourself in a brand new coffin
By morning, now you're the one with the night breed
You should've known better if you're anything like me
But the city lights will seduce you
Daywalkers beware if it's not what you're used to





I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up
Iâm tryna get some fresh air
Hey, why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
Hey, you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture
You ainât gotta draw no extra attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dyin' for less out here


I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babes
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror


I can't be ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints 
I need tints 
I canât be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints 
I need tints 
And itâs no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints 
I need tints 
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints 
I need tints 


You probably think a nigga trollinâ 
Or showin' out for the cameras 
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlinâ? 
One hunnid thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in His image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
 So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!


Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints 
I need tints 
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints 
I need tints 
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints 
I need tints 
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints 
I need tints 


You know I like it presidential 
Stretch it out, that's a limo 
Pull it over, let me get behind ya 
Where we goin', they don't need to know 
Ghost ridin' in the Phantom 
Niggas never see me comin' 
She wanna hold me like a ransom 
But the money keep me runnin' 


I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babes
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror


Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints 
I need tints 
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints 
I need tints 
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints 
I need tints 
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints 
I need tints 


I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming, no, no
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming




God damn, what?

Shit, what's up man?
Bubblin'! I see you my nigga!
Oh, thank you bro!
Ay, bro, I don't know if you- anybody ever told you this, you need to start sellin' bubble baths
Ah
Since you got the song "Bubblin'" so it's- bath bombs dawg! It's London, my nigga! You'll really win!
That's extra, bro. That's extra. You gotta chill, bro, you gotta chill
Whatchu mean I gotta chill, bro? Why are you rollin' yo windows up?
Just be- just be yourself
Bro, lemme get 30 dollars!
Ay, you got some lotion?





Natty Dread like Bob so rock steady
With no spaghetti with meat sauce
Maybe salads with one toss
No bread of the sorrow cause afraid to see tommorow
It's religion never suspicious
You're too delicious for the tongue
See the lungs breathe a natural high
Just like the shirts that's so lovely
So ask Marco Polo and I never go solo
Cause I roll with the crew that keep the funk flows
That make ya dance until the sisters take glance
I hope you find romance....try your luck take a chance
Til I enter like the Milton Plaza I'm the center
Of it all, the fuckin' prince of the ball
Standing six feet tall, that's a long way to fall
But not worry, cause my vision ain't blurried
The +I+ is hotter than the spice and curry
So don't stress the father or you might feel the fury


So check the situation, a raw deal is what we facin'
What's the flavour of the rules they mandate
The climbin' gets hotter as the city gets smarter 
A million one catch they tryin' to earn top dollar
Half that mill, they straight out to kill
I'm cultivated and destined to act real ill
Black let up in the things of five burroughs of pain
Only reason why the east and the west it ain't the same
I'm twenty-something years of age and life surely ain't about hand-outs
So I lace my plan out, hard work is levicated to an encore survival
Considergize less and from conception to arrival
Now that I'm here my fear shall decrease
Learn about life makin' my way to the east
From four square yard struggler
The G's on time, yo god hit me with that rhyme


In-tro-ducin the R to the O-B-O
You didn't know, I witness ya thoughts I'm Robodendo
But your inventions confuse me on the surface
Ya nervous, because your lack of purpose
Check it, thought about it, much much later
Should've kept it real would've been much greater
But, you got in it like a pussy, in fact
Bein' pussy kept your wack ass back
Now in '95 to 2000 Rob is on some next shit
Game type, yeah in ya heart, you know it ain't right
Dissention among the ranks
I'm givin' thanks to the most high for plantin' me firm
Upon this world that's forever changin'
The conflict that I'm engagin'
The concert with amiss communication
Imagine that me take the weight for some next kid short
Yo it's a Grown Man Sport


Yeah yeah like that
Laalalaaaaalalalaaaaaaaa
It's a Grown Man Sport, yeah
Laalalaaalalaaaalaalaalaaaaaaaa
It's a Grown Man Sport, come on
Laalalaaaaaaaalalalaaaaaaaaa
It's a Grown Man Sport
Lalalaaaaalalaaaalalalaaaaaa
This here is a Grown Man Sport


Hold it suppose it was me speakin' on tapes
To create a lifestyle to marinate
Different latitudes search cocaine to food
Excuse my move to bliss
Eternal stress in fits
I see the same in many, penny thoughts
Cause honey thought I wasn't ready but willin'
Now I'm blowin' through the ceiling
Go real only when a nigga make me any noise
So figure, the first letter supports the sport


Laalalaaaaalalalaaaaaaaa
It's a Grown Man Sport, yeah
Laalalaaalalaaaalaalaalaaaaaaaa
It's a Grown Man Sport, come on
Laalalaaaaaaaalalalaaaaaaaaa
It's a Grown Man Sport
Lalalaaaaalalaaaalalalaaaaaa
Yeah it's a Grown Man Sport
Like that
This one goin' out dedicate this one to the almighty god
Rastafari Selassie
InI as we come of for '95 '96
Ya live, respect





Uh-uh


Hiking in the sun the happiness that you mourn
You know the kids still dance, soâweâsupply all theâsongs
If I'm wrong, you hit theâsuperman like Soulja at war
You grew your hair an inchâlongerâforâthe clerk atâthe store
Growing upâman, PokÃ©mons in book bag
Can't you believe it if the panties never soaking
You said Jesus made sense to the chosen
If I'm wrong, the shell's stuck beneath the sides that you're on
To choose the quickest solution don't equate to your flaws
I know my black hearts sinking to the bottom of soles
I know my cheese stinks sitting by your highness in vogue
Ch-Ch-Chicken Little, who you telling secrets to, bro?
The pain made a new summer where the vegetables grow
We get it on , do the grown stuff, now play with this sword 
You know what I'm saying


Twistin' indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in the blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day-ay, oh-oh-oh, yeah


The power you've given me
The crack of dawn sweet cheer to the clipped wing
The planes fly and we the youngest in the stampede
To climb the slippery slope a decade old of doing me
L-L-Look, I got the black man balled in my fist
You laugh now, cry later, just empower the kids 
Growing pains, monsters all under my bed
Sweats when you sweating me, you looking real cute
You got a dimple under eyes, I bet you never knew
You look the thickest I've seen since the last time
Got us tickets for the show by the alibi
And all the things, all the things, all the days that we scorned
I can fly, I'm a dove, I'm a butterfly, yo 
I'm a butterfly, yo, fuck 


Twistin' indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in the blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day-ay, oh-oh-oh, yeah


It's inadequate, this elaborate floral display
They paid for bad habits, gaul and moral decay
To say what's unforgiveness, it'll all go away
Lay a plot to book a yacht out on the water today, porque
Is it so compelling, the rebel with all the yelling?
Now it's overwhelming, you're swelling melon, bruh, who you telling?
Dumb lust overflowing in love stuff, hush
Heart crushed like a bag of dust, bum rush
Black beanie, freak out at night like Whodini
Creep out the back and
Who coulda seen a G, easily, blue weenie
She couldn't dig it if it was too teeny
Bless her with the kundalini and plus the zucchini
Always been a plan to mush a heart melt, bird
It takes a steady hand to push these heartfelt words
I heard you heard, trapped in delirium
Thoughts of a queen to throw off your equilibrium
A few jokes, but the underlying fact goes
Itâs still a ray of hope to live happily ever after though
Disaster's what I asked her for
Now we stuck like plaster, yo, I has to go


Twistin' indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in the blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day-ay, oh-oh-oh, yeah

Seven years old, I asked Christ and the genie
Ten years old, I seen my friend die really
Genie in the bottle though it's Jenny on the block
I'm Houdini with the Uzi, holy father, wake me up
Time-traveller, that boy, he a star
Blowing bubbles in the faces of the people afar
'97 Hov playing, trunk rattled the car
Wet lick done licked the gold stars of my heart
Golden roses over enemies and sprinkled with serenity
Tryna stain the legacy, pray to Allah
And fo' sho', got you rappers Instagramming your ma
With that North Face jacket, blade tucked in my-
Way, way before the tomb came the womb, no question
And out came his black ass, remember, you was yellow with your
Black bandana with your fingers all twisted
June 19th '87 in the kitchen
The straw that broke the camel's back, in love with your life
Have you ever walked home afraid, alone in the night?
Have you ever taken drink inside the loo just in case?
Cause the fears of a man just like God to my cape
And the rap game crazy but the coke came at 'em
Eve came home feeling fruity and we smashing
All of that ass got me feeling real ratchet
The chicken came before the egg and way before the atoms
Cancelling the shows and making money off of acting
Rain, rain pouring like the bezels in my chalice


Potentially
We could build a galaxy
This you-and-I-verse could be
More than just the dreams of the living
I could see the you in me
So let's keep giving to the stars
I know that I could take you far
Far, far away from here


Where we should be
U-N-I-T-Y
Where we should be
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity
Where we should be
U-N-I-T-Y
You and me
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity


The man rose, little concrete roads
Put your hands together, folks, for the black roach
'Bout to deliver like Stagecoach
Know I stay posted, my nigga , yo, what's the signs?
My fountain of youth is all drying, one minute, we all smiling
Then poof, we fall silent and I've been digging deep
For this thing, I ain't finding this
Either I'm insane in my brain or to be honest, that's
Probably what it is
Done seen a lot of shit that you probably can't live with
You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times, we were so hungry, got mad dreams and wishes
It'll all get sunny, but for now it's this money that
Determines and divides, that's insuring our lives
Even causing homicides on the streets of NY
A little shorty asked me what's my purpose and why?
I told him save the children and point them right at the light
He said for sure, that's tight, but where the dollar signs in that
Them hella fine dimes with that ass so fat
That Phantom and the Maybach, that black MAC that go crick-crack
That's when I say yo, chill, shorty, relax
Let me open your mind to the current times
If visions is colourblind, it's fine, your light will still shine as
I consume this time he begin to unravel
And travel to a place he thought that he would never find, uh


U-N-I-T-Y
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity
U-N-I-T-Y
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity


Potentially
We could build a galaxy
This you-and-I-verse could be
More than just the dreams of the living
I could see the you in me
So let's keep giving to the stars
I know that I could take you far
Far, far away from here


Where we should be
Where we should be
Where we should be
You and me


What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta save, ayy
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
These are the days that we pray for love
Oh, I wonder, wonder, wonder: where is love?
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta save, ayy
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
These are the days that we pray for love
Oh, I wonder, wonder if it's up above

"Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him. I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker in town"

Who is it?
Well it's Grand Puba, honey 
With my man Stud Doogie, love 
Droppin' 2000 
Dig the way this go down 
Check it


I hit a flow all dipped in 'Lo
Sit back and sip Moe as I count my dough
Grand Puba Maxwell, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honeys know 'cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then it's all cream and baby
I made this one for the 
To find a hottie and dance body to body
Step one, first you grab honey by the waist
Step two, then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three, then ya look her dead in the face
Step four, now it's time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's, the teasa's
The one who wants the money and the Visa's
I'ma tell honeys straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, dig it
This one's designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time


Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City 
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya, and ya say New York City 
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City 
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say 


Could it be I've stayed away too long
Thief MC's be wishin' I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far, so stop wishing on a star
It's only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
It's no doubt I come real with that, the butter track
The one that makes the honeys hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm Simon and I said it
Ya see, my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe
Cause when it comes to gettin' down, I'm gettin' looser than a crackhead's hair weave
And I, betcha by golly wow
Ya never find another style like this if ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba nice your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
See, I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears, tears, dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit 'em with the , and then with the 
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb, baby?
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you


Ooh, yeah I like it

Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City 
Ooh, yeah I like it

Cause we get down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Ninety-five Flav, and I'm out
Ooh, yeah I like it
Ooh, yeah I like it





It's been a minute since I've been with some women
Not 'cause they been lacking, just I've been lacking the feeling
I've been staring at the ceiling
Listening to the chat that they're revealing
Wondering if I open up or keep concealing
I ain't try to be demeaning, it seems
Thought you knew this, I don't really do this
Moving like a Judas
Talking all that talk but ain't no time for acting foolish
When you ask, all of the brothers saying, "True, this"
I might just jump on this for free, jumpin' on them freestyle
I've been well, moving brain, senile
It's sole sunsets, beautiful is one guess
One morning afternoon in that sun dress
The summer flies by every morning, I'm still yawning
Same conversation, never boring



I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you


Ay, and then you say you ain't about guys
Ay, especially brothers from the south side
But been about mine ever since the drought now
You and me been living on this cloud nine
Saying it's about time, stunting, front like
Nothing will change until it drains, ain't nothing the same, uh
'Cause you become like the blood in my veins
Saying I'm way too young to be stuck on the rain
And still it's peak weeks 'til I figured out you played keys
Eighteen, you been listening to Jay Dee
Blaming the bait trees, telling me you hate these G's
But didn't need me telling you they ain't me
Because they ain't me, uh, they ain't me
Don't need to know about the colours that they paint me
I've been too busy getting dizzy off that JD
Dreaming of the places you could take me, so now I'm saying


I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you





Yo, each one, teach one, we reach on
Maryland and Cincinnati to the Far East, son
And we just begun to spread the gospel
Substantial, Pase Rock hip hop apostles
Far from preaching with this art you call rapping
Taking y'all back from before this all happened
Fronting hardcore when you're barely soft porn
Never penetrating the inner to get your heart warm
Rock on at a ridiculous pace
Disrespect hip hop and I'll spit in your face!
These kids are a waste of oxygen, it's madness
Get in your case and all your shit like back checks
Got my eye on ya like insanity grabbed ya
Y'all CD packaging, and I can't stand rappers
You're bound to get ripped and then turned into garbage
I'll stay blessing mics; my followers pay homage


Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing itFive Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it


On point like the pens we write with
Living righteous in these times of peril and crisis
The pain'll squeeze you lifeless 
What's it matter who's the nicest?
Who's alive, who's gonna live to see their life is
Hopefully me
My lifeline of emcee extends past to paying duesâhow much it cost to be free?
Deep-rooted underground, but on the surface, a tree
Branching outâall I ever really wanted to be
They want to put us in a box and then pack it away
But we ain't having that, no pause, no which way
Yo, I'm going to the top and that's where I'll stay
Fuck the middle ground
Cold, getting biz while you was sitting down
The joint sound hitting now, freestyle or written down
Your flow is played out, moneyâyou need to get that shit in style
Speedy on the quick, fast; Long-term we make it last
Forever in a daze, stay clear of the path 'cause, yo


Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it


Children of the Sun, look out, here we come
Live in Brooklyn; Maryland's where I'm from
We don't stop  'til you've had enough
Five Deez, UV connectâthat's what's up
Children of the sun, watch out, we're coming for ya
Rocking from the 'nati mid-west to California
And it don't stop even when you've had enough
Pase and Substantial, dude, that's what's up
Blessing it effortless; testing this? Doubt it
Mic specialist, son; we kept events crowded
As nice as you wish you were, ripped mics are my signature
Thought you said your shit is hotâit's barely room temperature
We're scorching, torturing cats from Cincinnati to New York and back
Word to Pat, don't say jack
When we bankrupt your crew from spinning the Wheel of Fortune black
We take you there and send you walking back!


Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it




Intro
Yo, who got my lighter ?
Oh ..

Verse 1 

Sky walker joints in rotation, inhale soâsoothing
Fateâgot me hereâin this booth now Iâm facingâthe music
Heard Fleezyy rap heâs a fool this should be amusing
Devilish flow the way niggas get to rebuking
Spit like Iâm toothless
Or like I smoke loosies
Donât need double Gz to be Gucci
Kick her offset if she bougie
I packed 5 Jawns in this 2seat
Stay with the dimes like Iâm Stockton
Iâm tryna turn to a new leaf
Up in these bars yeah Iâm locked in
Hope fed ex donât open them boxes
Realest nigga in the county
She want a ring, get an Audi
I heard the price of my bounty
Shit bout the cost of a Island
These bitches wildin
I swear I been on more flights than yo momma
Since I pierced my nose it just boosted my confidence
Now they all call me the cockiest
Gave me the sloppiest scholarship
Vision Iâm chasing is opulence, I could not wait for a 6 figure check
To just stuff in the faces of niggas who thought
I was wasting my time tryna get out the jects
Imma put two tones all in a piguet
I ainât forget when you left me on read
Now In a day Iâll be smoking your check
Blowing the finest no lying the best

Verse 2 

Donât pay attention to drama I just be coolin
Told ya last year in silence is how I been movin
T up to Dirty Ike at the light while yâall be cruising
Feel like JR, niggas looking at me like the fuck is you doing
Only calm down a 5th of Brown or some music
Shorty got the venom and I know she know how to use it
Might be an addict for sex donât beg but cannot refuse it
Matter fact Iâm single yâall can double up I can give 2shits
I'm like word I can give 2shits 
All up in her FDR roofless 
Flow is nasty is all Iâm talkin smooches 
Fuck ya empire fuck Lucious Music
I will take a check tho
Man you talkin bout death why you running your mouth
Why you rock a patek you ainât gon flood it out
Whatâs the point of the neck I canât nut in your mouth
Young filthy fuck, cape gon catch some wind I never have my silky tucked
Post a snap in city island I said I'll think bout it girl donât crack a smile I think about it
Chin got a lil mink around it
Chest got a lil ink around it
Fuck you with a pink medallion I donât give a fuck bitch





I flew in a vibe, imported the haze
Stuck in my ways, you thought it's aâphase
Stuckâin my city,âyou thought it's a maze
Stuck inâmy... hey


We got freaky on our first night, she surprised herself
I think she got  by the life I live, I know she can't help it
I'm not mad if you don't understand it, you have to live it to get it
So I get it, if you don't get it?
We came here to bounce
Young nitty and proud
Came back online I was off for a while
Said it's not me, but it was, I done her all over the house
Like a hurricane I roll up a paper plane
Like a hurricane I roll up a paper plane
And I'm sipping on Henny, no Bombay
Have a shot and it might go the wrong way
My brother fucked with you the long way, full of talk never trust what a fox say
I done left the barbers with no fade, happiness I'm still trying to locate
And I can't fuck with a broke lady
And I'm tryna get paid, gotta stay motivated
Yeah


I flew in a vibe, imported the haze
Stuck in my ways, you thought it's a phase
Stuck in my city, you thought it's a maze
Stuck in my... hey


I'm cool, look at my face, do I look bothered?
Catherine Tate, I took Catherine down to the Tate
I take your girl on a little date, lobster croquette on a little plate
This is a game, nigga I just play it
She clocked it, but the game ain't clocked her, yeah
I just Henny and rocked it, yeah
Yeah, you know I got this, yeah
Got her screaming like foxes
Yeah, yeah drippy I rock this, yeah
We get jiggy she pops it, yeah


I flew in a vibe, imported the haze
Stuck in my ways, you thought it's a phase
Stuck in my city, you thought it's a maze
Stuck in my... hey





Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James


Dickie shorts, Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folk, "Damn"
Oh, Lord


As the plot thickens
It gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Olde E, I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set it Off," in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song"
And the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas don' start bustin', "wham! wham!"
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talkin' 'bout
"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation


Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James


Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes 
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute


Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja





Oh
Uh, hello?
Homie, wait, I think he wake up
Hol' up


There's somethin' knockin' loud on my window 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
But mirrors all I see 
Who could that be at my window? 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Sayin' all I see is me 


I don't ever trip, I don't ever sit down 
Hit me on my hip, we gon' shut that shit down
Tryna get a grip, I don't wanna fall down 
Down , down, ayy, ayy
I don't ever trip, I don't ever sit down 
Hit me on my hip, we gon' shut that shit down
Tryna get a grip, I don't wanna fall down 
Down , down, ayy, ayy


Now look, I caught rabbits way before rappin' 
Way before they cared if I looked unhappy
I mean way before Michael Jackson looked nappy 
Way before the blonde hair , blue-eyed tactics 
Uh, I know mistakes get pushed to the masses
I read the how to's pushin' black magic
I'm hooded up stars and my view birth accidents
Seven months later, you be crawlin', my bafflement
Out the packagin', how to's nada
Press play, I recharge, so run, Roger
Planted that seed so my tree lives longer
My daughter got eyes on the prize like her mama, I'm ashamed


There's somethin' knockin' loud on my window 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
But mirrors all I see 
Who could that be at my window?  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Sayin' all I see is me 


I don't ever trip, I don't ever sit down 
Hit me on my hip, we gon' shut that shit down
Tryna get a grip, I don't wanna fall down 
Down , down, ayy, ayy
I don't ever trip, I don't ever sit down 
Hit me on my hip, we gon' shut that shit down
Tryna get a grip, I don't wanna fall down 
Down , down, ayy, ayy


We on the edge of my bed
You know I can't cut my dreads
You got me missin' my ex
I'll put the X on my soul
You know the karma I dread
I mean I love you to death
You know the butterflies roam
I took a trip to your home
I heard the stereotypin', I quit
Call me accountable, yeah
Very deceite to my kin
Drown like a fish in the sink
Rappers in plastic, I waste
Look at me feedin' this kid, diapers all in my crib



There's somethin' knockin' loud on my window 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
But mirrors all I see 
Who could that be at my window?  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Sayin' all I see is me 


I don't ever trip, I don't ever sit down 
Hit me on my hip, we gon' shut that shit down
Tryna get a grip, I don't wanna fall down 
Down , down, ayy, ayy
I don't ever trip, I don't ever sit down 
Hit me on my hip, we gon' shut that shit down
Tryna get a grip, I don't wanna fall down 
Down , down, ayy, ayy


 I just wanna tell this nigga  
I think he just gon' ignore us 
Man, let me just go home
Oh, oh, oh 
Rude ass nigga 
Ooh woo, woo, woah, woah
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Sayin', all I see is me

It be the, funny brother with the fattest of flows, connect, slick back your neck, slack, rock off your dome
It's poppin' off a lot, riddim'll get diminishing more off the top, Molotov effect as I elect the next interject
Get into it. Fill em' up with with words, emerge victory. Turn 'em into something, fronting like a don, literally. Causing me to piss myself viciously with laughter, after must award these actors with a Bafta
Fully on form, we warn you step lightly, wreck mic with passion rivalling Aphrodite. It's the core rhyme scheme, believe, we seek knowledge more horrid when we enter and revent
Pent up energy relent
Lend it here and we will show you what real is, no pretend
Real music we defend, truth is, but that's a friend
Trust
Truth is, but that's a friend
Believe


This one's done got me thinking, tick tock, i'm over low flows to go. See it's much more than just for listening. Sound expand and open soul. See some head's still got it twisted, that's why good vibes no longer show. Only going on, showing off, they witness. We bring the sweet sound, rock the show



Now more than ever, i'm in it for the music. Sound checker, check the sound, that's how we keep it lucid
The round ready, wreck a town, steady with the moving. Lounge heavy headed now, bevvy n' the zoot spin
Two, two, check, mic too gone to do this. Too much to stop, rock the room when I prove it
Whole crowds lovin' it, bubbling like soup in a pot. We keep it moving whether you're moving or not
Still killin' the riddim as if i'v been given a gift
Pen, pad, scribble scribble scrunch paper in the bin. More soul, write crazy. Crowd syncopated, isn't this a given when i'm on it. Bunnin' em with nothin' but sound
Reach out, yeah we surfacing, certainly heard of him. The verse alone with leave him purple, we verbally hurtling across dimensions, journey ending with a pencil and a will to go on
Ticking over to the future beyond


This one's done got me thinking, tick tock, i'm over low flows to go. See it's much more than just for listening. Sound expand and open soul. See some head's still got it twisted, that's why good vibes no longer show. Only going on, showing off, they witness. We bring the sweet sound, rock the show







Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme


Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Heh, okay, you on point Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point Phife? All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip


Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word


Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out


Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer And me, the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Ayo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip? All the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yeah, all the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yo, all the time, Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life


Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And properâwhat you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop


NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
In London, check the rhyme, y'all

I'm dodging all them thirst traps, they tryna think they hoeing
But I know you ain't on that
Aye Shoutout all my niggas in it from Maryland to Flatbush
And vacant love to all my *unknown* cause that was really *unknown*
That booty had me like
That booty had me like that board of school that dude to roll into
That booty had me nice
I got the booty and her booty but that booty had me twice
To it felt like I could change the world
That booty had me siced
I Grew Up, Brought My Crew Up, and Lighting My Dula

Temporarily until he sent the sun and told me to *unknown* and give him all the message done
*Unknown*

This is not a Migos song I ain't ad-libbing
Nostalgic feels I'm establishing
Thrift store nigga, but I mix it with the Raf Simons
On the block getting mobbed by the pretty womens
This ain't the Ryan Leslie Show you can't get a diamond
Fade away on all you hoes like Gianna Bryant
If I had a daughter I would teach her how to kill in silence
Like a Mamba pray times still vibrant
But how yo daddy taught you
I knew that when you got older, You was gone drop 82
Get on any beat that they put me on, Know the flow would catch you
I was blessed by the holy one, I didn't have to at you
"Yessir"
I got a 007 presence, I know the white girls chase me
They get the 007th heaven
Maryland nigga the state I'm in very pleasant
It's a difference between a gift and a present  wassup


This just a Poetry Jam
I don't got friends, I got Fam
Young nigga from the Motherland
The drip that comes from the kicks in Japan

What'cha Want





One, two
Yes, The Roots layin' back, rela-xin'
Coolin' out with my man Malik B
We call him Sla-xon
YaknowhatI'msayin? We in effect
Mode like Al B. Sure, for your plea-sure
Aiyyo bust it
We about to flip it on some ol' laid back, mellow my man tip
We gon' set it like this
Yo check it


Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party
Like Slick Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick
Got soul like those Afro picks with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin' like John the Baptist
It's the cause of that "Oh, shit!"
The skits I kick flows like catfish
And got many MC's on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus, plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Us, Roots is really true to that rap shit
Now, holla to the scholarly street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach
Offender wanna go like Meshach, Black
Thought the nappy cat, a bookworm, shoot styles like sperm
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand
Of my mellow my man, Malik B


Here I goes, negroes best to know the flower
The pro-fessional, best in those skills that kills so uhh..
WHOA, slow down before you go down 
Sissy, this is Agatha Christie - you're slain and known now
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats
Put him in a quote, when he croaks
They sayin' -- isn't it, is it the negro that did it?
Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'
I exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny norms
 on the norms
Capture, was to, whack ya
Manu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rap-ture
I figured, perhaps ya, a say it SLAM
For my mellow my man


The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man

No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man


Yo, I got spunk, plus funk And Jump Like Punks
To Get Beat Down,, turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool
Deeper than the pool that Wilt the Stilt damn near drowned in
Clowns bounce to sound when Thoughts poundin', brown's
My complexion, section Southern
My brother-in is Jex, I
Sweats no sex, 'cause this kid gets
Grits 'n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed
When your heart spit up, dip, dup, damn
Yo, I lost it but back is the Black Boogey Man
Manic mad musician, maker of noise
That's jocked by your homeboys
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found, now I gets down
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can
To my mellow my man, Malik B


WHOAHHHHH, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks 
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts
In wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap 'em
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap 'em
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats 
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust 'em
Even though I lust 'em shapes -- females for retail prices
Twice this nice as with sugars and spices
I won't smirk, 'cause my name's not Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagerize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hypocrites
And nit-wits, with tidbit skits, that ain't *shhh*
It was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin' the wrath
Of Malik, ayo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap, I will just slap YOU
If you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome
And then we cap, YOU
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check
For my mellow my man


The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No no we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man

For Scott Storch, my mellow my man
Leonard Hubbard on the bass, my mellow my man
Brother ?uestion on the drums, my mellow my man
Gotta end it on the one, my mellow my man
Check it




Talking all that jazz


Yeah
So pass the mic and let me motivate
Movements for the music get your soul to shake
Hold on wait
Claiming youâre the sickest and they sold no tapes
I can tell you're rookie from your jumper stage till spitting in your vocal break
Today I woke up late I was dreaming scheming
Trying to find some deeper meaning
Astral projecting Iâm beaming
Can someone help me get down from the ceiling
Cause Iâm floating puff-puff pass then I know
Iâm toking potent to keep my focus open
Iâm in the kitchen cooking soul food
Same time Iâm having sex over the surface
Coops you so crude
Most of these rappers ainât got no clue
I got that special recipe
Their necessity they bringing less than me
So be ready to draw your weapon see
Cause Iâm a veteran G
I write this bars using telepathy
Leaving MC's in jeopardy
No one can second me
Iâm moving to guys like Kazuya  in Tekken 3

Pleaseâ¦

Stop talking 
Stop talking 
Stop talking 
Stop talking 

Yeah
These man are jazzing
While Iâm on the beat spazzing
Got the magic touch Iâm guessing he hasnât
And her feet in the air
Tell her to give her an orgasm
Opened  with a small cousin
With a thing that should win
The beauty pageant
Imagination coordination
Of my demonstration through the celebration
Of microphone exhalation
Got no expectation for this generation
In this foolish nation
That is trying figure who is the coolest waste man
In this world of product placements and mass displacement
I just stay making bangers in the basement
Keep the world adjacent
This is a scary place where is Freddy and Jason
Feeling to smack him in the face
Iâm aggravated and impatience
Terrorizing the terrorist Iâm trying to fuck my therapist
Living in London till it's derelict or they bury it
You can find me on the ferry list smoking on some cherry shit
On my way to Amsterdam the way I live is very sick

Yeah

Stop talking 
Stop talking 
Stop talking 
Stop talking 





To myself I keep, that's the recipe
Greediness is an ingredient to lesser sleep
Rest easy, getâmyâblessings in theâthreaded sheets
Buy my book of life,âthe lessons deep
Accept defeat as a cost, and not a lost
A pause is nothing more than the play you're involved in
Days are short and when you're the sun, it's where it revolves in
Let it rise in another's eyes
The death of one thing is not the total sum demise
My daughter looking at me
She's the difference in me, being not just looking happy
Prioritize my mortality, nothing more than lies
The metaphor for my methods will be my daughters' eyes
My elder told me I'm the first man she will ever love
Good luck to the person that hopes to be above
I've seen enough to help me read a bluff
The beast slayer let me feast on it to eat it up
Now we suppin'


I just mind mine, abide by
My own rules, guidelines
Blueprints, white lines
Drove through, drive-by
I just mind mine, abide by
My own rules, guidelines
Blueprints, white lines
Drove through, drive-by


I was never one for crowds and overt noise
God showed a sense of humor through my work choice
So, the stage became a sacrificial altar
Not a pound of flesh, but the feeling's nonetheless
So, when I'm done, I jack
Rechargin' what is left in a three-star room
And the iron's unequipped
Straighting out the here and now
Tears reserved for people who feel that they are beneath you
Sympathy is scarce from the shoulders that just wants to be you
Confessions in the mirror again
I need direction to correction, becomes clearer with pens
If I wrote this on the wall, I'd need medication
But if I write this in the pad, that's just meditation
A thin line 'tween wallpaper and stationary
Dark torture with flawed mind, don't think it's scary
So, I keep to myself, but can I be explained
And in the chamber, what remains, with no shame


I just mind mine, abide by
My own rules, guidelines
Blueprints, white lines
Drove through, drive-by
I just mind mine, abide by
My own rules, guidelines
Blueprints, white lines
Drove through, drive-by

I just mind mine, abide by
My own rules, guidelines
Blueprints, white lines
Drove through, drive-by
I just mind mine, abide by
My own rules, guidelines
Blueprints, white lines
Drove through, drive-by





"Resurrection"


Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town


I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense


"Resurrection"


I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
 I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm


"Resurrection"







Why don't you just chill?
Just chill out a little bit
Why don't you just chill out?
Why don't you just chill out and listen?
Got things on your mind that worry you, keep you awake?
No, I just don't sleep much
You don't sleep?
I don't sleep
I don't sleep much
I don't sleep


Boom, bad rhythm for rap is baptism
And it might save souls if mass is half listening
Phoniks on the tracks, the brass is in the pocket
When the jazz and this hip hop mash you can't knock it
You can't stop it if you tried to
If it died, Don't Sleep revives this so it thrives through
And as long as we alive too
This is Michelin star in the kitchen, no drive through
Dephlow cheffin' it, Awon preppin' it
Tiff's got a bottle on deck most definite
Niggas can't question it, it's always raw
Like the sun don't shine, we just always are
Like you all can't see what we always saw
We was never up close, we was always far
Now we almost here, neither here nor there
And niggas fear no men, nor fear no fear
I got no fucks left to give, one dream
Gun too big, can't tuck in my jeans
Everyday hustle never touching the thing
And you wonder how I'm balancing weight with one beam
Haha
It's a mouse click
This is Auschwitz
You'll never doubt this
They ain't about shit


They called me the agent of change
Since I came in the game
I really came from slinging them thangs
Made about a buck fifty an hour spend it on Jordans
The rest of my bread was for reein' up and recording
Hotel rooms, copping fifths on the weekend
My classmates in baby pools, I'm swimmin' in deep ends
When sharks see the gunfire spark from the barrel
Like the cherry on the blunt to get designer apparel
Where they ante up, yep that fool
Killer Mike tight, better run them jewels
Spittin' bars in luxury cars
Hot boxin' with dope, boys put money on my rhymes so hot
Then a foot in the booth and a foot on the block
Then wisdom of the streets don't sleep, it's not my option
Deph on the left and Tiff on my right
And Phoniks on the beats, it's one helluva night huh





Yeah, yeah
Just got in the-


Just got in the habit of switching the flow
Just trying to travel the globe
Tired of being underlooked in this bitch
Tired of hearing "I can't wait till you blow"
Had to step out of my shell for a bit
Cuzzo told me put my foot on they throat
Had to let go of some niggas last year
Wish they'd let my nigga out on parole
Niggas used to bump The Warm Up by Cole
My nigga used to warm the house with the stove
Shit, if he made it out of this bitch, ain't no telling where my talent can go
Skinny nigga from the 4, used to battle rap niggas for bread when I'm bored
Fuck what? Your boy used to swerve in a Honda Accord to the store
Hit up the Midget for Newport 100's and lottery tickets


Now I be whipping some shit that I prayed for, all my shit paid for
Niggas'll switch on you quick like what team do you play for?
I dead a fake nigga like case closed
All my life, I been ten-toes, G.E.D. my initials
So fuck what you talking, I get every dollar
I don't have a collar, if I did, I would pop it
Like "nigga, what's popping?" But bro, I can't call it
Like look how we started, but now we here
Niggas throwing shade out of fear
'Cause where I'm at, niggas see they self
Don't be mad, bruh, just be yourself


'Cause money come and go, people come and go
The sooner you know that, the more that you'll see
Blood ain't no thicker than water to me
I count every dollar till my thumbs bleed
She said I got Marvin Gaye vibes with the drip 
If I don't fuck with the vibes, Imma dip 
Got hollow-point tips in the clip, shit
How many y'all club with the whip?
Who gives a damn what it's worth?
A U-Haul don't follow no hearse
I'm real 'til I exit the earth, we from where you mix the water with dirt
We had to make that shit work, the struggle been quenching my thirst
I put the tears in my verse, so I get the shit I deserve
We came from nothing at all, if we have a problem, we solve
Figure that shit out ourself, turn all my pain into wealth
Turn all my pain into wealth, shit


Now I be whipping some shit that I prayed for, all my shit paid for
Niggas'll switch on you quick like what team do you play for?
I dead a fake nigga like case closed
All my life, I been ten-toes, G.E.D. my initials
So fuck what you talking, I get every dollar
I don't have a collar, if I did, I would pop it
Like "nigga, what's popping?" But bro, I can't call it
Like look how we started, but now we here
Niggas throwing shade out of fear
Cause where I'm at, niggas see they self
Don't be mad, bruh, just be yourself





You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for
You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for


Uh, it all started when you were year above
Uh, before I had a fear of love
Before, back when I adore, but now I'm fearing of
Before every other fella I was hearing of
Back when the day would fade to grey when you were clearing off
âCause now I only make love if Iâm in love
You wasnât in love, then what dâyou think, love?
Thinking Iâma hold you on the brink until we sink
Fade like a barber, rather have another drink
Love, Iâll drink up and disappear, âcause honestly you donât need me here
Itâs like you need it, canât defeat the fear
But now I see it, canât believe, but I read it clear
Play me like an arse, I wonât spend another evening here
Deep, the evening clears, drowning and stuck
Just know you clouded my guts, going down on his luck
But now I sit in a hurry, worried nuts that I bust
Knowing you only went down to f***, so what the fuck is up?


You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for
You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for


Uh, check, look
I know this shit sounds philosophical, with borderline ironic, but this topicâs very logical
Whether itâs a blessing or a mother fucking obstacle that breaks apart and leaves the broken hearted to the hospital
Powerful devotion for some, when I was young
Lack of any kind of emotion, had me hopeless and numb
Back when I was dumb, I was never running my gums
Just always running from webs that I spun, stress weighing a ton
Weight was more than I was able to bear, âcause in my mind itâs mad fruity to be labelled a pear
But blatantly scared, escaping any fragrant affair
That was my duty, always threw me into times of despair
Writing rhymes to try describe the many times that I care
âCause honestly, to put it properly, Iâm underprepared
And who am I to play the castaway? Iâve got a bigger part to play
So, when they ask me, it ainât hard to say, uh


You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for
You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for


Uh, uh, so why you crying?
Stop the crying, I werenât crying on you
Stop the lying, worry âbout them brothers lying on you
Theyâre sliding on you, bump ân grind every night up on you
Getting sly up on you, cry up on you, then get tired of you
Bawling âcause I ainât on you, what the fuck you mean
Uh, closest to trust I ever seen
Well shit, well there, I said it now, forget it like a dream
No regret, canât forget the shit you seen, shoulda kept it clean
Uh, you shoulda kept it clean
Canât forget the shit you seen, you shoulda kept it clean
Trust, uh, you shoulda kept it clean
No regret, canât forget the shit you seen, shoulda kept it clean
Uh, you shoulda kept it clean
Uh uh, you shoulda kept it clean
Uh, you shoulda kept it clean
Uh, ânah mean?


You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for
You donât know, what Iâm looking for
You donât know oh, what Iâm looking for


Mmm, you donât know what Iâm looking for
No no no no no, ooo
You donât know, what Iâm looking for
No, oh oh oh, mmm





Bro I swear I haven't been over 1935 
Bro how you gonna graduate?
I don't knowâmyâGPA's like aâ1.4
That's nuts bro, you're fucking dumbâas hell
We got this music shit though
Ayo what's Jack been up to though?


I wake up tired as fuck and my class already happened
Two second Uber teacher said I wasn't passing
And there's nothing I can do so I'll just stay in bed relaxing
But my mama's fucking fuming cause my parents still tracking
Stamp student union for the Chick-Fil-A
Post another song everybody got some shit to say
Skip the interactions
All I care about is passing
And I probably won't give a motherfuck if I graduate
So homie pass the jay
Trynna smoke a jay with J but J's a bitch
He will never smoke a jay he's steady playing games
We're on the same page though
Same spot like the pay phone
Random numbers calling all the time help the bank fold
Ben's chilli bowl and some Cody Ko
Hit the drive through subsequently after smoking dope
We just at the rodeo
Hopefully we have some time to kill but shit we probably don't


I don't know why I'm even here, I'm stuck, life in Maryland
Time has been moving way too slow
I'm fucked
What's a terrapin 


Walking to class hoping that life could be different
I'm not talking 'bout growing up getting married with children
I want my parents in a crib that takes an army to build and
All my siblings whipping sports cars
Fuck a damn report card
The beach breeze and the drugs you can't OD on
Miss the days when Mr. Pechet would call me Ophinon
Now we're doing magic and I'm also doing magic
I got 30 different camera people
My life cinematic
I could die at any moment
I promise it'd be okay
Imma counting off the study aid
Aderol to get the grades
Hitting old town to find a blond bitch to serenade
Hit it once never called again be on my merry way
If I let this bus hit me then I'll cop my free tuition
Watch this shi-
Oh fuck that shit just actually just hit him 


I don't know why I'm even here, I'm stuck, life in Maryland
Time has been moving way too slow
I'm fucked
What's a terrapin
I don't know why I'm even here, I'm stuck, life in Maryland
Time has been moving way too slow
I'm fucked
What's a terrapin





Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do


Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-making
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep fronting and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home, giving crowds what they wanting
Official hip-hop consumption, The Fifth thumpin'
Keeping your party jumping with an original something
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, "Yo, we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew, but, um


Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do


Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying, rent paying life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music running through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to


Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do


Living the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listening start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short "I want it made" like Ed, 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuing to


Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do





Smooth: You got that good hair too
William Douglas Street: You like what?
Smooth: I like girls with that light complexion on them
Street: You're a moron

Verse 1: Tiff The Gift
The rain in the sun shiny moon will move my darkness
I can't stand the pain through the portal of my heart
It's unlawful to part, from all that I've been taught
Existing in the world of togetherness my apartment
Full of candle lit for my dearly departed
My heart is cold and I wonder where the time go
5 x 5 speed wonder where my mind be
God is good, life's great, the Devil up inside me
Learn to catch up or walk softly beside me
Dormant in a corner or on a path to a dead stop
Hold tight ninÐµ close wonder when that lÐµad pop
Here but I'm soon ghost, hold onto that bread pop
Only I'm concerned with the bag until my breath stop
Loyal to the core veins, pull for the Genesis
I'm silent you disloyal, third eyes for my enemies
No word, I'm a slump, I'm poor and Iâm penniless

Hook: Awon
I woke up and it was pouring down rain
One of them days I was feeling immune to the pain


Verse 2: Awon
Rain against my window pain drives me insane
Black clouds impairing the vision of the lane
Mastering the game the emperor has yet to reign
Rule in the coldest vain, fueled by my people's pain
Cuz when all you had is change, you fall for anything
Taking scraps I'm baking up tracks and kicking up stacks
While niggas take naps, the moniker is Don't Sleep
Perhaps this little rue still move like a smooth criminal
Token at whose calculate snooze, test me you lose
Who hesitate news player this is a straight groove
Lyrical ill, sickness I spill, beat is on chill
Phoniks and Will colder than those who think drill
This is a skill, one in a mill, do it for thrills
Folding a bill, folding yo grill, when wrong goes real
Mass appeal, glad to build, but it's survival
Master on the mic stop praising false idols

Hook: Awon
I woke up and it was pouring down rain
One of them days I was feeling immune to the pain






I don't ever wanna do what you do
Got a bunch of gluten in your doodoo
Iâbeâin the shedâmakin' heat, heat
You be YouTube 480Pâ
All your bullshit, I'm beyond that
On the back porch adirondack
Bet you didn't know that my mom rap?
Hit me with a text "You the bomb, Ash"
I'm like


My girl bring me flowers on the weekend
Making sure I can still smell them
My girl bring me flowers on the weekend
Makin' sure I can still smell them
Gimme that


I'm framing photos from Mexico City, my livin' room
Be lookin' pretty from the interior decoratin'
My lady be slayin', I ain't playin'
I'm playin' like only Mozart on vinyl when I wake up
No pay cuts, only gettin' raises and bonuses
Caladiums, roses and, only that potent shit
I'm growin' and goin' in
My flow is some stoicness
A poet that coexists with the coleus, no coinci-ince
Coincidences
Good riddance will finish
Make sure I finish my sentences
Dementia is no friend of the penmanship
I thank all my friends, ain't never forgettin' my friendliness
No reason to censor it
I love the smell in September, it's kinda like...


My girl bring me flowers on the weekend
Makin' sure I can still smell them
My girl bring me flowers on the weekend
Makin' sure I can still smell them
Gimme that
My girl bring me flowers on the weekend
Makin' sure I can still smell them
My girl bring me flowers on the weekend
Makin' sure I can still smell them
Gimme that





I heard Akin got the fiends copping real hop and been rocking
Shit hot since Kane, Rakim, Big, Pac and Reebok and
Rob Base's âTakes Twoâ.  Strikes hit in Beirut
Crackers in the White House and weak rap that make you
Recognize finally just why y'all rewinding me
Like Cube in the tape deckâbet thatâs what the CYNEâll be
Hardcore sonically, circa 80-now shit
All I see: suckâand fuck it.  I renounce this
Eight-man, hip hop gorilla, all-monkey type
Shitâs surrealâfor real, Iâm living in a twilight
Catch me if you can cause, man, Iâm time bandit
Trapped in Jim Crow South with John Landis
Peace-love nigga, but damn.  I can't stand this
I'd rather talk race, war, sexâthatâs quite candid
Cool nigga who figured Iâd be the new nigga
No shame or guilt, though.  Casanova thrillâmo'
Ladies with they legs wideâgoodbye to dildos
Yeah, goodbye to dildos


So what you want?  That music that bump?  Then give it up
For these two niggas at work and bet it up, fucka
Live on the setâthatâs us.  Elephant stomp
You little earthling chump.  And keep it moving like
Them boys donât know how to stop.  So call the cop
Cause a New World Orderâwe are
Elephant Rome


Spark radiant, shine summer fire that works wonders
He ice-glass prism in the sun that blinds others
The serpent and the rainbowâhe bright like Day-Glo
Colors within the black light a price to pay, though
Heâs still like three assassinsâstance of a dragon
With eyes of brown fire, he breathes with a passion
Deeper than coal minesâmy mind is disaster
Fuck up shit like FEMAâno help for you bastards
Loves to pick fights with third world regimes
Adult Swim through wet dreams.  Final Fantasy king
Pilot without a jet jet-set, so whoâs next?
Aviator with legal papers, walking the lineâyes, yes
So what's the reason?  Itâs the focus and thesis
Creativity my deityâI worship uniqueness
Searching for peace tearing me into pieces
Itâs smoke and mirrorsâdonât fall for cheap tricks


So what you want?  That music that bump?  Then give it up
For these two niggas at work and bet it up, fucka
Live on the setâthatâs us.  Elephant stomp
You little earthling chump.  And keep it moving like
Them boys donât know how to stop.  So call the cop
Cause a New World Orderâwe are
Elephant Rome


To my family, I drift apart.  Canât blame it on the art
This music I made my love.  I chose the life.  I was
A schoolboy, big dreaming.  NaÃ¯ve youth gleaming
In me was old souls.  They begged to scroll poems
Inspired by Nasir Jones to write the life unknown
Break from robotic life.  Plus, I'm aquatic type
Free as spring water.  Itâs like I gotta prove self
So I sing harder.  Hoping Iâm understood
My time like see-saw.  Paradise
Slice night today and bring war.  Reality.  Therefore
Apologies will go to
Ife, Moji, and Kemi, hug my nephew
Itâs been a minute
Damn, Rashid Lynnâs pen handed me ammo
To break out the jungle.  RumbleâIâm now Rambo
Rounds on my waistlineâshoulder kids, scramble
Quick for the fix while you trap stars ramble
On your big yacht, big chainâkill sambo
Yâall awaited hip hop emancipated
MTV wack rap crack sedated
The souls of black folk sold for gold-plated
Ornament.  Man, peace hip hop belated
Peace hip hop belated





What y'all know about them wild niggas
Devil child niggas
Have-you-kick-the-bucket-say-fuck-it-and-smile-niggas
The type to catch the Buddha buzz, slide up to the fuzz
Sayin "Officer, run your shotty before I catch this body"
I knew this nigga Smokey, sorta like his pistol
Barrel when you're in peril and shit like that was wanted
But later that would die down
Sorta like many abandoned that he ran with
His block felt sorta haunted
His only solitude was wifey, word to life, G it seemed
They was together forever and now the womb had been seeded
He needed a job and the robbin wouldn't do it
He wasn't tryin to go out like Diquan in Strapped
Her mother was a nurse, her purse was chubby
From the hospital she found Smokey some work and shit was lovely
With some cream in here, feed a patient there, he had loot
And not a nigga on the street would have to get that pocket tapped
He's workin in maternity and learnin
Seein much about the infant children
To be skilled in fatherhood
Stealin baby stuff home for self
And he didn't have to pull the Mac-20 off the shelf and get...


Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....


In Maternity, Smokey saw stuff, raw stuff
Make-you-drop-your-jaw-stuff, hospitals get sorta wild
He saw some babies shakin, awakin if they were fortunate
His soul was scorchin, it would have thinkin of his child
Later there would be no "Honey, I'm home,"
Strictly "Woman if you jeopardize my seed, dead up, I leave you wet up"
On the block, a flock of zombies entranced
By the peddlers of temporary ghetto heaven had him fed up
His job was gettin hard to fuck with
They had even had him stuck with the disposal of the stillborn
Poisoned by the nourishment, the ill torn soul from flesh
From the womb to tomb
Seein shit like that'll have you crazy
That night he had a dream
And it was a child nursin upon the semen of the glass genetalia
Clouded nut after clouded nut
He woke and shouted "What the FUCK is goin on?"
Smokey was Swayze, it's time to get....


Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....


He figured there was only one way
As he rushed the runway lookin wild deranged
This was common, without any qualm inside he was tookin
Lookin at fiends of the pebble adored praised
Devil for lord raised from the crystallized tombs
Through fumes from the floor
Blazed the sole sacrificial altar
He chose now to halt the worship dealin that ultimate headrush...
The lead crushed, buyer or seller decoratin hell a flame
With the choir of the firearms to blame
In the mornin by the time the smoke cleared
Everybody seen the massacre, the local folk cheered
"Oh, thank the Lord Almighty," the pharmacy was out of business
On the L a chubby widow cries alone because her man had gotten...

 
Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....





Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better


Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked 
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand put you under quick
Big mama said, "The Devil's up to no good"
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book 
Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look 
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu
Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light, saying


Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Pain will make it better

Pain will make it better


No wetter, four-letter, mo' better
Slow pain, no gain, go-getter
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that gain makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang-bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation
But not for me, G, Iâm into public relations
That's food for your De La Soul, word to the letter


Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better



The bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus, talking Watts to Mobile
Now we're on a house on a hill
Struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
When life came with a couple of spills
But we're gon' use that pain for fuel, so


Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Pain will make it better

Pain will make it better

Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better


Your music means everything





Uh, check, uh, I kind of miss my student loan
Uh, I miss sitting in the student home
Sharing stories now I simmer sippin', sorta Rome
Walking like I've been talking the talk but can't afford a phone
Trust, I'm all alone panicking to play it safe
This talk of paper chase is forcing me to stay awake
Living this layer cake where others will say youâre straight
Say they got my back and that they're praying
I'mma pave the way
Like it's the great escape, brothers doing better than me
I'm in a hurry, worry, what if they forget about me?
I'm just another number nothing when the cheque will bounce
See now we're moving for money
But there's nothing but debt around me
So when the rest have found me buggin' in the brain
And I'm somewhere between the struggle and the strain


They ask why every fucking song the fucking same
And I tell them it's 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed


Check, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Uh, uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Brother, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed


'Cause this is for the men of the house who were far too young
See your friends are growing up but feel you can't do none
You're raising funds for your mother and your canât do sons
Up in the rubble raising trouble, what you canât do is run
And trust I feel it, I feel it, but can't conceal it, see
This inner city responsibility's killing me
I start to shiver when I think of all the shit I need
And see all my brothers burning paper on that sticky greed
Picking the thickest leaves stuck in a mitt
Taking a shit, I should have quit but couldn't fucking resist
And now they sit with a lager, little luck, and a wish
But trust they still blow their mother a kiss
They're living up in the bits
And slip, stagger through the puddles and the pain
Somewhere beneath the rubbles in the rain, uh


They ask why every fucking song the fucking same
And I tell them it's 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed


Check, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Uh, uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Brother, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying, ain't nothing changed
Nah, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed


Uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed, uh
Uh, I'm saying ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Uh, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed, uh
Uh, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed
Saying ain't nothing changed, uh
Uh, 'cause ain't nothing changed
Trust, 'cause ain't nothing changed





Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Living good today


They say rap's like a trap, so I'm looking for the map to the backdoor
Sometimes I sit and wonder what the fuck I'm rapping for
So many cats more talented, that never had a chance in it
Not to mention niggas tryna damage it
Cold hearted vandalists fucking up the culture
They acting like it's kosher to rap for the advantages
Making the game scandalous
Stranded so far from the art, you start to wonder if they ever was a fan of it
I'm digging in the crates with the candles lit
Looking for a record to describe my anger so I can sample it
Condense my feelings into sixteen bars
And try to sugarcoat my quotes so they won't seem raw
And I can tell what you folks' dreams are
Cus all the video shows is hoes jocking, niggas knocking on cars
Now the young'uns want a piece of the pie
So the devil let's them starve and start feeding em lies
Now try to digest that
And you wonder why we buy stress sacks
To shit out what niggas dish out without Ex-Lax
I'm trying to get outta the west coast, Blacc
It's a bad place to raise fam, and I'll be damned if I ever get back
Where shit's at now, it'll make Martin Luther shake his head
And sit back down, like "did y'all niggas had the same dream?"
And Malcolm X would wonder "all y'all are on the same team?"
The way these fiends keep droning on in the mainstream
The lame thing about it, it's the same teams that bought it
Probably skipping this song, Build the walls around the ignorance
Defending what's wrong, instead of fighting for freedom
That's why I only write in what I believe in and nothing less


I shoulda listened when my Moms told my ass "stay in class"
Shoulda listened instead of ditching to get a little ass
Or maybe I shoulda listened to my Pops
When he told me hip-hop won't do shit, but keep me on the block
Or maybe I shoulda listened to my niggas pitching rocks
'Cause they pushing nice whips from cooking white bricks
Or maybe I should be like my uncle
That nigga pimping white chicks, but none of em lead a life like this
It's like the right do righteous to try to stay the fuck out of hell
But me, I'm tryna stay the fuck out of jail
Cause I can smell trouble coming my way
Plus there's so many reasons a nigga wanna keep a gun to his waist
It don't take much to make him pull out
Cause niggas die for their rides, money and broads or calling the wrong hood out
And suckers still tripping on colors like a motherfucking racist
My cousin was banging at my Aunt's cookout
It's a full-out war and I don't know who to listen to
I thought rap was a positive gap I could get in to
But nowadays you gotta bust a cap if they dissing you
Either that or be labeled a bitch cause you didn't shoot
It's hard to pick and choose right from wrong
Like if you rap about freedom, nobody likes your song
But do a track about cheating, bitches will play it all night long
I don't get it why the righteous fall
Like my ex used to bump Xzibit and her favorite line was
"I be catching bitches while bitches be catching feelings"
Yet she don't want me tricking around
See, she idolize the lifestyle but don't want none of it going down
It's kinda like these phony clowns thinking they hood dwellers
Acting Mafioso cause they seen Goodfellas
Now they running through the hood yelling Blu is bucking rounds
Bet you're giving your attention to me now





I don't know where I'm goin'
Ifâ I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'


Iâ ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowlyâ lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Getâ nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Lateâ night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
Weâ don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved


I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my


Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options


I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'


I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my


Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme

To anybody listenin' that's in between



Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here


Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire 
But you know, you know that's a lie 
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire 
But you know, you know that's a lie 


I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my





Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day


Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now, when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way


Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day


I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got




Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay


Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day


I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got







I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, you're dead!




Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever





Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Push out your back, put ya butt in it
Wanna love you, but I do not wanna commit
So I dance with ya with the thought of us fuckin'
We dancin' up in the corner, feelin' for the corner pockets
So I ease your work for just a bit, uh
Buy your drink, you have a sip, uh
Then I tell you we should dip
You grabbin' me close and closer 'til you get a kiss
Push up your bra to the left, that's right
Now we in a car with a broke brake light
Thinkin' 'bout the ass, the legs, the head, the sex
The whip, the figure-four leg lock, then we dip out


You say you wanna party all day 
You say you needed lovin' from me
You say you wanna party all day 
You say you needed 
So why waste time? 
So why waste time? 
So why waste time?
Why waste time? 


Ayo, your boyfriend pissed off, smackin' his lips off
The fact my lips are covered in your lip gloss
I say we should dip off out of here
Talk, speak, share some words, grab a ear
Nah, you can't take off, unless you leave your amigo
Swallow your pride and put aside your ego
Man, fuck bein' modest, I'm just bein' honest
You seem home-cooked and them goods McDonald's 
But no, the bid is off 
Niggas always dip and they duck the sauce 
Rocks on my neck, I don't know the cost 
Car out front like the Uber, Uber 
We can hop in, and you can top ten
The list that I wanted to hop in 
List is full, so I'ma call it a night 
And you ain't even my type
I'm all bark, no bite, I'm so sorry 
Wasted time, I wasted time
Why you dutty wine, it's whatever 
You sweatin' drips upon my sweater 
It's hot in here, the outside's better 
I'm leavin', leavin', you call me back, it's like emotions recedin'
Let's call it a evenin', it's gettin' desperate, yeah


So why waste time?
You say you wanna party all day
You say you needed lovin' fromâ 


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah





We've been through it all, though it could be worse
We've been moved around in a state of alert
There's nothing new or sharp about the cutting edge
If they build a wall, let's jump the fence, I'm over this


Cold stares can never put the fear in me
What we built here is godly
They can't gentrify the heart of kings
Let's just not talk about it
If I make a move, you're coming with me


What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? You're coming with me


Hey
 Hey now
 Uh, can't stay now
 Until we get what we need, oh yeah
 I'm okay now
 Yeah, can't hold me down
 And let it fall like the leaves, I wanna know


We couldn't stand to see our children shot dead in the streets
But when I finally took a knee
Them crackers took me out the league
Now I'm not much for games
But I play for keeps
And we salute King James for using his change
To create some equal opportunities


Cold stares can never put the fear in me
There's a movement we've been groovin' on
You can move or stay your ass asleep
Let's just not talk about it
Everything they tried to hide
We're taking back for yours and mine


What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me
What about the love
What about the seed? It's coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me


Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down 
Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down

And when I pull it, you gon' call cops, ho stop

Nowadays, I swear that they was never reaâ 
For me comin' from nothin' to get it very 
Determined to prove that I would be legendary 
I only got one life to live, yeah 
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary 
Until I'm dead and buried 
Up in a cemetery 
All that other shit is secondary to me
Put that on my life, that's word to my mama
That's why I grind and I serve for them commas
'Cause that's what it's like bein' birthed from the bottom, ayy
I know you heard that I'm poppin', ayy
Came from the dirt, now I got it, ooh

When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free


They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"

It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search

They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter, I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself, oh no
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
L.A. for four months, end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city, bitch, I sleep in my hat, uh
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there, he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs, I'ma get to the gate singing


Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh, all my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah


Hey! Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray, I got to pray, like Hammer after "2 Legit"
I got the power, I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrape om stupid shit, I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much
You'd think they drive an Uber whip, damn
Queen said, "Why we in a queen bed?"
I said, "It's yours, don't worry, lil' beanhead"
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo
She said, "Cool, just bring me some food"


Oh, all my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
I'm gonna finish mine, yeah-eah


Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do




The water may be deeper than it's ever been


Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love


Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown


Never, never, never 
This thirst in my soul 
Where else can I go?  but You? 
I may cry a river 
But You take each drop and You wash 
Me new 
This water is deep 
Jesus, rescue me 
Take me to Your mountain 
So someday Chicago will be free 
Be free 


The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown





Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm good, ooh, yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good

So good

Even better than I was the last time


Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good, igh


Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
I'm good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm good 
So good


Work, work, work, work, bang, nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldnât be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, "The Rapper"
Magical word , please say "Kadabra"
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck, a nigga's fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
Ooh, yeah, I'm good, so good 
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm good 
So good


Even better than I was, even better than I was

Even better than I was

Even better than I was, even better than I was

Even better than I was 

So
So, so
So, so
So, so, so, so, so, so
So, so, so, so, so, IGH

So, so
So, so
So, so
So, so, so
Did a good ass job, did a good ass job
And I'm good
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Igh, igh, igh, igh, igh
Igh





That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it 
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it


Uh, look
My girl tripping, say I treat her like a groupie
But I never took a groupie out to eat, uh
See I been ballin', I been poppin', I been bubblin', I been buzzin'
In my city women love me, think I'm pretty and they confirm it
Whenever they see me in person
If I said it I meant it, I said it on purpose, don't sleep on that furnace
'Cause, boy, we hot, ain't it my job to make you think
And make music that you feel? Then these songs should make you sing
Woahâwoahâwoah, I guess we never know
 What we need to know, where we need to go
Mind in the right field like I'm Ichiro
I shed light, they need to grow, fuck 'em all, fuck they friends, fuck they car
Fuck your brand, fuck your blog, it's SaveMoney
We a army full of generals here to push the envelope
And change what they think, it's my job to make them think
And make music that they feel, so these songs make them sing like:


Woahâwoahâwoah
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Woahâwoahâwoah
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows


That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it, love it, I love it
 Love it
Love it, I love it


 
If I drop it they gonna cop it
I might start a non-for-profit, my poppa say, "Chancelor, I am so proud of you"
Like my beats? They made all of them, kick my feet on the ottoman
I just might run for Alderman, you got power too
Sneak that rap, put a message in, it's that sugary medicine
Feel like the intro, but better than it's ever been 
Jumping like checkers, clever like chess is
Smoking like purp is, perfect like Surf is, deeper than surface
Anxious and nervous, the world isn't flat, it's sharp as a circus
It's starving like sharks is that's looking for surfers
I'm not in the industry, not in the service, not into retail
Not into nodding my noggin, neglecting the detail
I'm only beginning, behold magnificence
Brown-skinned black boy when his dread-head friends tall and omnipotent
You choke like cinnamon, you broke, I been the man
Triiibe, SM and 197 at your fuckin' neck, boy 


Woahâwoahâwoah 
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Woahâwoahâwoah
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Woahâwoahâwoah
Where the end will go? 
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows 
Woahâwoahâwoah
Where the end will go? 
Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
 


Ayy, why you about to have the hottest tape of 2015? It's stupid
This song is already so hot, I'm actually just glad you let me rap on that bitch





Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt."
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"


And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass


Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
âCause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go."
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw


And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass


You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help


Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine


And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass."
None shall pass, none shall pass





Yeah
Fuck that, whoa, uh


Fuck that bitch, I changed the plan
Switch my style like I switchâhands
Blockâthe witness, takeâthe stand
Fuck out the way bitch,âback it up
Shit better get played in a palace 
I can't treat niggas like big deals
Why put up a front? Iâm callous
Bald 
I look like Ray Allen 
These niggas make beats on big wheels
Yo' files is not a challenge 
Boy, you can't rap for shit
Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance
Bald


Yeah
My life was written already, so I was gifted already
And with this God-given talent, I knew the Devil been met me
Can't compare me to Jesus, because he ain't Noah's father
He told me, "Please, be still and see that steel is revolver" 
'Cause in my hood, these niggas poppin' mollies and shootin'
I'm stressed the fuck out, that's why I must commence to get zooted
I'm trapped in my head, between the thoughts of health and my wealth
Right next to bein' selfish and just bein' myself
The fast spitter, slash, clash, ghetto pass, sinner sippin' bad liquor
It's the nigga you may know, I'm the GOAT
To them clout chasers and them 'bout whatevers and them wave riders
Told them that my life is not a boat, you can't float 
Call me Zeltron when I'm rappin', call me Denzel when we fuck, ho
You're allowed to touch me, but I don't wanna keep in touch, though 
Say I'm livin' comfortable, because I'm makin' much dough
But I wasn't happy, cut my hair and let the sluts go
Ever so softly, suicide has cost me
Did I lose my mind? I feel my head been lost me
Been a couple years and haven't spoken to Lofty
Haven't seen the family, only been with the posse 
Couple gold plaques, scratch that off a gold list
Cold shit is gettin' diamond plaques by stayin' focused 
No whip, I won't let 'em do me like Jahseh 
My mama say that I should pray, 'cause demon comes in different shapes 
Got that Stray Rats on my body, 'cause Maurice don't fuck with BAPE 
All these bars that I be writin', make it hard for you to relate 
Hesitate, I rarely do when fuckin' these hoes I barely knew
Overturnin', startin' new, can't act like a jit by thirty-two
I'm twenty-five, though, dreadlocks had your boy like Sideshow Bob
Can't complain about too much, because I'm on my job
Switch my look, I got 'em hooked, they call me Young Heartthrob
I am

We enjoyed it but we never used to like rave to it





Bitch nigga
Nigga bitch
Oogie-boogie nigga
Sniff it up
Fuck nigga came to my section on Sunday, didn't evenâbringâshit or bottles,âjust ate, drank and dipped, fuckânigga
Yeah, ayo


Scammin' niggas maxin' out, ratchet bitches actin' out
God made me sell crack so I'd have somethin' to rap about
Lobster lollipops and crustaceans, ho, what you mad about?
I fucked you twice in Vegas, that pussy wasn't shit to brag about
And I can't draw for shit, but I knocked a bitch that I paid to sit
Magnums and some sweet aromatics, yeah, bitch I came equipped
I don't do no sucker shit with no ho, mistletoe and Christmas exchanging gifts
She don't like it, bitch can punch out, niggas be changin' shifts
Yeah, you niggas bringin' out the old me 
I'm tryna live to 93 and see the old me
When I touched that crack, I let them crackers take control of me
Serve the beast, Caprice ain't got no heat, man, it was cold G
Record labels downed me forty thousand on my first advance
Fucked up on my taxes, IRS kept me on payment plans
Crime fuckin' pays, but once you paid, you gotta pay the man
Straight survival, right hand on the Bible, I won't take the stand
Yeah, VL niggas trap it out
Lord let me hit this ho so I have something to rap about
Been through shit with hoes that I look back and I can laugh about
This shit wasn't no joke, sittin' in that cage, this shit was draggin' out
Diego trippin' cause I'm sittin', ain't no package out
He robbed the plug, kicked in the door and cleaned the mattress out
Right back in the trap, these niggas bringin' out the old me 
I'm tryna live to ninety-three and see the old me 


Ayo
Nail is in the coffin, Freddie sent me this shit
This sound like the boat I haven't bought yet
This sound like the moment I jump off it
Sun shinin', cold water fillin' in my pockets
This lake water better than the faucet I grew up with
We hold our breath like grudges 'til we nauseous
We hop out, let the sun dry us like raisins
We get dressed in some Gucci or Lacoste, shit, it's amazing
We look like Polo ads but skin is darkened
I gotta move cautious 'cause niggas malicious, they come from the trenches
I used to be a Goblin under them bridges, now I'm a businessman
I started gettin' moola as youngin', now I got bigger hands
To hold 'em, if I got too much on me, I know my niggas can
I keep my circle tight like tops, nothin' corn, no crops
You messy and get cleaned up with the mop
I went to school and I ain't miss it a lot
So I can be around niggas like you and learn how to keep my distance
I cut some niggas off on some hater shit niggas said to me
R.I.P. tees 'cause these motherfuckers is dead to me
Nail is in the coffin, murder, murder
I'm sick of y'all niggas and I ain't coughin', I know me
Y'all often anxious, lost in y'all thoughts and I don't relate
So keep that energy away from me
Don't blame me, 'cause you ain't got it figured out
You ain't got the bigger house, the jig is up
You jealous, dawg, my afro long, I'll pick it out
Like cotton on some basic, shit is off
We ain't adjacent
I'm grounded like the pavement, we ain't linkin' like the bracelet broke
Better get your wrist that hold on the thoughts you get and go
The fuck away, 'cause niggas get they faces broke
I just got a thumbs up and niggas go, like, "Good job"
You better find a shoe store and get your sole
Get it quick and slip it on
And I'll be in "My-konos", lemonade, sippin' slow
Jumpin' in the water off that boat I haven't bought yet, bitch


One take
Let me hear that
I meant to say "Mykonos" 


I think  that he died from alcohol 
But if you write dog shit, it doesn't do any good what you dieâ
Teach the parents to be civilized people, becauâ





Oh 
When we rappin'? 
Uh


Pray , pray
Pray you get comfy inâyourâdisguise 
Pray forâmy thots on the other sideâ
Pray for my children I can't provide, I'll feel 45
Pray when you shoot, it's a homicide
Pray for my haters, they terrified
Nigga, come kill me, I'm verified
But I'm still alive, yeah, I'm still alive
Pray that I end up like Charlize Theron
I'm so confused, I ain't hard to find
I push you pussies beyond the pine
Hope you get some shine, hope you get some shine
It come out the pocketbook every time
Feel like I'm shootin', I'm shiftin' time
Dressed in your grandmama's hand-me-downs, pussy nigga
Huh, sucka, I'm prominent, I was anonymous
I been in front of you every time
This ain't a bridge, it's a collared crime
I put my soul into every bar 
Into every verse, into every rhyme 


I can't feel my face, oh God
SMH, no ASMR 
Show me where the prophets go
Show me how to keep my pussy closed
She said, "You better count your blessings for real"
Amen 


Pray , pray
Pray for my babies, they doin' time
Pray that these crackers don't Columbine
I just pray that I peak before my decline
Make 'em hit recline
You know my shooter a proper dime, clarity
Nigga, these bullets get entered in clip
And go into the Kimber that hit your spine
Britney, this a sign
Pray you grow healthy and hit your prime
Ooh, I should pray for a better line
But I don't wan' make all my peers resign
2035, I'll be 45
They say the church leave us all behind
Speaking in tongues like I'm David Byrne
Bitch, I turn a threat to a nevermind, nevermind
Pray for all of these niggas been lyin' and frontin' for company
Bitch, I'm a diva, no punk in me
Fuck you want from me? I'll put you under me, nigga 
I put your soul in a struggle bar


I can't feel my face, oh God
SMH, no ASMR 
Show me where the prophets go
Show me how to keep my pussy closed
She said, "You better count your blessings for real"
Amen


Praise the motherfuckin' lord








Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?


This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free


I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king





They want my bidness on the front page 
I put prescription in Dior frames 
I had the vision back in 12th grade 
That I'd be killing shit with Doc Dre 


I never want it to ever be over 
I'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder 
Drunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur 
Check out my jiggy, check out my, uh


Now, who are you? 
I don't know, no
What you do? 
I don't know, no
You short a few? 
Oh no, no, hold up
Pull my sticky out the jar, come on


Ooh savage, that's a nice get-up
International, rocking Japanese denim
Enough gas to get you above average
How many more drags do I have to puff from my cigar?
New enemies, they bringing my old ways back
Back in my day, woulda had your whole face smacked
Look at you niggas, wonder why I fucking hate rap
Ooh, what make you wanna go and say that? 
And I'm on another wave, and I'm puttin' on suede
Niggas feeling overpaid, fuck I'm 'posed to do? 
Don't nobody know your name, we ain't ever seen ya face
You ain't ever gang-bang, what you tryna prove?


I never want it to ever be over 
I'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder 
Drunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur 
Check out my jiggy, check out my, uh


Now, who are you? 
I don't know, no
What you do? 
I don't know, no
You short a few? 
Oh no, no, hold up
Pull my sticky out the jar, come on


I've been swimming through the process
And you can't see me, I'm the Loch Ness
You could proceed, but with caution
Give the proceeds to my god-kids
Old dirt on my conscience
Same nigga my pop is
Lame niggas wanna pop shit
Get dropped quick by a drop kick
Why you gotta lie to me so much, babe?
You tell me the same shit that you told what's-his-name
If it don't work out, I'll go back to hustling
Couple hundred-thousand up in my mother's name, peace
World peace, niggas talk about "Don't shoot"
Tell that to police, mmm
Scared, ain't none of them prepared, I could see
Promise I'ma get them commas before I decease


I never want it to ever be over 
I'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder 
Drunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur 
Check out my jiggy, check out my, uh


Now, who are you? 
I don't know, no
What you do? 
I don't know, no
You short a few? 
Oh no, no, hold up
Pull my sticky out the jar, come on
Now, who are you? 
I don't know, no
What you do? 
I don't know, no
You short a few? 
Oh no, no


Hey, AP, let it ride out





Let that shit run, uh, fuck!
Fuck is, fuck
Alright, alright, alright, shit

Ah, fuck! Uh, uh
S-Stop, it's over, uh


Peggy, where you been at? Getting all this promo
When it comes to money, bet these niggas is a no-show
I've been out in Bed-Stuy, chilling with my feet up
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us
When I say us, bet, I don't mean no fucking crew
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes and Goofy Troops
Catch me out in Barksdale, counting fettuccine
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville, strapped with a Kimber
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder
Now I'm at the White House, looking for your President
Hop out the van, pointing guns at your residence
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now, showing y'all a body
Hoping that you pussy ass c******s try and find me
Chains on my body, looking like a rapper
Acting like a slave when Iâm gunning for my masters, nigga


Fuck these niggas!
Buck these niggas!
Yeah


Itâs ironic you pressed for a cooking
Itâs ironic you talk jail time, but you ainât never seen no central booking 
Itâs ironic you hang with a nigga that beat women
And have the nerve to call yourself "Girl Pusher," wow


You ainât real, you're a Jarrod, Iâll show you how I really feel 
White boy better put his hands up, Iâm ready


And Iâm getting Wilder, shoutout to Deontay
Country niggas booming Peggy, Iâm the new BeyoncÃ©
Devil on my entrÃ©e, cut like Dante
Promise I will never go blonde like Ka- 
Promise I will never go blonde like Kanye?
Got so many styles, they should call me Peggy A.J
When I hit the stage, niggas know itâs a payday
Tell your bitch, come here, like I work for Midway, nigga!



Like fire





Good evening
All right
Yeah
Happy to be breathing
Yeah
I am alive
Yeah
Yeah


"You look like you've seen a ghost"


Are you asleep? Or are you
Are you awake? Nah, man, I'm done
I'm showered, I'm everything
Ate some fuckin' Lucky Charms
Let's go


Most copious, rains soaked the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm, focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly
On the lawn, let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking his water for too long
So when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning, he would tell 'em
"I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome"
Interesting in a sense
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue
Said, "You're living by the bayonet "
Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table, lobster bibbin' on the ready set
He said, "But how alive?", I dunno, homie, you decide
 Fine! How alive? Too alive
 Too alive  Too alive
And one by one around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs 
We the legends that hunt with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh, money's in the market for a mothership
To double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it
And who am I to hang him out to dry by the heat
When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me?
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The "Too alive" channel from the library of rivalry
And summers in the mud , winters by the tracks 
No story goes untold, Aes is back

I got a handful rockin' the same poker-face
Down to dance around the table like they own the place


"You look like you've seen a ghost"

I got the whole world thinkin' it's a holiday
'Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away


"You look like you've seen a ghost"

 Too alive
 Too alive
 Too alive
 Too alive
 Too alive
 Too alive
 Too alive
 Too alive





Yeah, Vic said he want that blue collar rap
Man how Iâm suppose to bring blue collar back
I guess Groggs is Phonte, and I am early Ye
'Cause I ainât Big Pooh man that nigga kinda lame, yo
Had that nappy headed nigga on they payroll
Had a S on his chest since the Muppets
I canât wait until I can get to stunting
Get a Tesla and take it to West Coast Customs, itâs nothing
Me and my niggas get it jumping
They askin for a brotha at the door like Lauren London, in Frontinâ
We been on, we been on something
They just hella mad 'cause the kid been buzzing
What you know about a young nigga like this
What you know about a young neighbor like this
I did the second one for the white kids
'Cause I know you wanna say it, but that ainât right kid
This that Aquemini plus a Pisces
This that fuck you come and fight me
To your boss 'cause he just thinks youâre a nice kid
And could care less if your future was the brightest


Ya what you know about a young nigga like this
What you know about a young neighbor like this
I did the second one for the white kids
'Cause I know you want to say it, but that ainât right kid
What you know about a young nigga like this

'Cause I know you want to say it, but that ainât right kid


Ya, with a S on my chest, yo

Iâve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If youâre going and going going
No test for rest, ya
Ya, and they like how I roll
Remember when a nigga was 5â9 with corn rolls
Now I need mink suits for the whole show
We need Groggs in all pink or all gold
Yah itâs time to floss
All these other dudes they ainât down at all
Ever since a Motorola, Iâve been down to ball
Iâve been, Iâve been going no time to fall, I said
Ya, with a s on my chest, yo
Ya Iâm the best Iâm the best
Iâve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If youâre going and going going
No test for the rest, ya


Ready to tour the world Iâm done with this local shit
If you got crazy bars then we the loco-est
Stay with an Aâs fitted like Coco Crisp
Ya Iâm athletic even though Iâm kind of husky
I got that bay game I still pull the girlies trust me
Fuck you, Iâm a lady killer
Word to Green, Al or CeeLo
Iâm just a common man out here trying to do it for the people
Looking at these rappers I donât see too many equals
Stay drinking liquor 'cause it got me feeling good
Even though this nine-to-five got me mad stressed
Got me smoking more blacks than the hood
But really itâs nothing to me
No time for losses, all we do is see Wâs, you like âWhatâs a W, B?â
Since weâre talking about Dubs weâre the best in the west
Here to save the game with this S on my chest


Ya, with a s on my chest, yo
Ya I'm the best I'm the best
Iâve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If youâre going and going going
No test for rest, ya
Ya, and they like how I roll
Remember when a nigga was 5â9 with corn rolls
Now I need mink suits for the whole show
We need Groggs in all pink or all gold
Yah itâs time to floss
All these other dudes they ainât down at all
Ever since a Motorola, Iâve been down to ball
Iâve been, Iâve been going no time to fall, I said
Ya, with a s on my chest, yo
Ya Iâm the best Iâm the best
Iâve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If youâre going and going going
No test for the rest, ya

Hey, no ins and outs
You come out, your shit is gone, bitch


Goin' back to Tangier with some Jordans and a spear
Post-Christian shit, post-chicken-or-the-egg-addiction shit
Pass the sherm stick, Neo-reality
Be the freak you wanna see, just don't follow me
I'm on a journey to the center of three
Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
While everybody's like 
I got this pregnant snake; stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the Apple Store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares, cut the birth cords
Press send, yeah, thick
Gaga can't handle this shit, headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of Linens-n-Things
On the way, never call it a day
Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today
Still on the way, bigger wigs


When you come out, your shit is gone

You'll catch a jpeg to the head, Ã¼ber reach
You're an intern, I'm Wikileaks
Most loved, therefore most hated
Come and knock on the door, we've been waiting for you
Game changer, reclusive-aggressive
Ying-ing and yang-ing, noided
Info warrior, Jack the Hacker
The rolling stoner, puffin' on disaster
My existence is a momentary lapse of reason
Got the DNA of gothic lemons
Shred it thirteen times out of eleven
Your bad ideas are the ATM, shed my skin
Leave it for the homeless to sleep in
Prodigal, fuck that, nautical
Teachin' bitches how to swim 


I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm inâ

Teachin' bitches how to swim
Teachin' bitches how to swim
Now backstroke, through your k-hole
Don't run, you might slip
The table's flipped, now we got all the coconuts, bitch


Burmese babies under each arm
Screaming beautiful songs
The cray-cray ultra-contrarian
Havin' conversations with your car alarm
When you come out, your shit is gone
Soon your crew will be serving sandwiches named after me
Vietnamese style, fool, please
Front row at the mass games, untraceable by name
You speak of us in certain circles, you will be dethroned or detained


Gone, gone
Your shit is gone, gone
When you come out, your shit is gone

Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out, huntin' for the truth

All this time searchin' hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'

Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say, âDamn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on
I won't relish on the fact I'm vibin' on the future
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia
Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland

Okay, everybody wanna be a nigga, but nobody wanna be a nigga when it's time to be a nigga
If you thinkin' it, then say it, when you see a nigga; please be clear, I rhyme, I do not mind read
I ride the beat then have your girl ride the C-train to me to ride the D
And give me brain, and you can see the stains I place upon the sheetâoh, you gon' come for me?
Well, my nigga, you better have an army at leastâmore than a gun for me
I'm more than a man, not a God, but the boy is a man, we ignore all the noise from the outlandish
Standout with the cannon, outstandin' south bandit, don't panic, please, 'cause if I get nervous we get un-sturdy and we start to squeeze


Okay, niggadom
Nigga from nigga slum
Blue tongue, red tongue
Nigga flavors, go 'head, son, get you some
Nigga got a lot of gifts but
Package store was always open
Jail house don't ever close
And my world view was always shut
Trap spot was always bunkin'
Neighborhood was always crunk
See I was outside riskin' snakes eyes
With my life chances, stakes high
Only outlet was the moon walk
Michael Jackson dances, so shuck and jive, nigga, bust a nine
Shoot behind the line, my only advances
USA eat me like a cancer
UK eat me like a cancer
Gettin' money and they tag the crib
Ask King James, "what's the fucking answer?"
Still a nigga out in Calabasas
Still a nigga when I greet the masses
Oval office, presidential grasses
When I fuck my white girl and I meet her daddy
I know deep down inside, man, he hate that shit
Plotting for the perfect time to bury me
Nigga, please, show 'em the green like a caddy
Verena, Serena them daddy
But that shit don't change my appearance
Asians like, "That's my nigga"
Latins like, "That's my nigga"
White folks like, "That's my nigga"
'Til it's time to die, bye, bye, nigga
Now don't get offended, I was just giving you hard time
Come to your block, give you hard line
My, did I come at the wrong time?
But see I sent comets to the Earth
Me, I was humming at your birth
I put colors on the spectrum
I let you assign them worth


Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace when I stare at you


You know I'm here for the nigga shit
Whole life been nigga rigged
Since my momma let a project nigga hit
Set it up so when I meet the reaper
Let my son reap the benefits
Nigga shit on social media
Get a nigga pinched, end up in the pen
Surrender your independence 'til the sentence finished
Even with no pot you got a cup to piss in
Burning bridges with my tunnel vision
Bitches leave niggas for cunnilingus
Fuck me like her nigga non-existent
No negativity, niggativity
Why you being silly fucking with me
Giggity giggity
When I'm in the city
They like, Doc you litty
Not as lit as I'm finna be
I just wake up and do shit differently
I can never say they doubted my ability
Along the way some niggas just wasn't feeling me
Niggas lost faith and quit on me
I just tuck 'em in the back of my memory
One monkey don't stop no show, my niggas got goals and responsibilities
So you know by any means, really mean any and everything to the team
Nothing off limits nigga, ain't gon' keep shit clean
Me and my niggas them niggas that they should've never let go free
Niggas got me talking through my teeth like I'm 50 Cent in '03
Ain't no Kunta Kinte, nigga Toby what they told me
"What it's gon' be?"


Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you

Come off your gold chain

Come off that lil' tennis bracelet 
I'm takin' debit cards 
Yeah, get it off me 


Yes, lawd
Someone hit me the other day for a rendezvous
"Long time no see" was the time she used
Bright eyes like the lights at the carnival
Held convos, but never held accountable
How's your Mama Duke? How ya papa doin'?
Oh, me? I been freer than the sample food
But like a sample loop, around and 'round I move
Until it's clear, then I'm back to baggin' bags of loot
Spent years tryna steer both hands on you
'Til I finally understood that I was spinnin' my hoop
Rather spinnin' my wheels, gettin' up in my years
But still I feel like a kid when I'm fuckin' with you
Young nigga gotta live, that's the motto they use
But all them niggas still live in they mama's backroom
So I'm back in my stu', lookin' up at the stars
When they reminisce over you, my God


That's when I caught light of myself 
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself


It won't fade
Won't fade, won't fade
It won't fade
Won't fade, won't fade


Yeah, yeah, huh
And if you would've showed me more than one time
It wouldn't have been clear, I would've just played it off like
"Alright, I'll deal with it when it gets here"
And I remember when I used to live for more
Than just the useless fix, before the allure of sin
Would cast the black mask over the consequence
I did right by you from within, and all of a sudden
After I run in, it all starts comin', comin' back
To what love is, and it don't fade 
It don't fade 
And it don't fade, don't fade 
And it won't change 
Kinda like a dream the way it all happened
When all the laws of attraction
Break all the walls I was trapped in
I can see you comin' back to back with me
I wanted to learn more 
I wanna love more, more 
I wanna get further 
It's not too far from home 





Yeah, sorry for the ruckus, but no group gonna top us
Step out for some airââcauseâwe droppinâ likeâcorpses
Better put me on, ruthless
Dr. Dreâshittinâ bricks, make him stutter âcause Iâm lucid
Iâm the horsemen they call me the rawest
Iâll put you in a mothafuckinâ coffin
My talkinâ stuck in yo nogginâ like a mothafuckinâ cough
Then, profit, take em all out like Iâm Robin


 Off with your head, bruh
Donât talk, poppinâ off like the meds, bruh
Limp walk
Canât stop, on the run from the cops, bruh
On a chase do me dirty for some commas
Dirty for some commas


Stop this, stop this, baby just stop this
Everybody know Iâm a mothafuckinâ monster
Came from the sand, now my wrist like a faucet
Needed a way out, so we found our only option
Baby donât pause this, only needa watch it
Foot in the door with nada to fuckinâ start with 
Bitch Iâm on gold
Bitch Iâm on star
Motorola phone with my busted ass car


 Off with your head, bruh
Donât talk, poppinâ off like the meds, bruh
Limp walk
Canât stop, on the run from the cops, bruh
On a chase do me dirty for some commas
Dirty for some commas
 Off with your head, bruh
Donât talk, poppinâ off like the meds, bruh
Limp walk
Canât stop, on the run from the cops, bruh
On a chase do me dirty for some commas
Dirty for some commas


What does it mean to me baby
Need to leave lately
The desert it too cagey
Hunger been on the daily
Picked up the pen, like how can you blame
Saint Santi bitch thatâs the new name
Sand in these veins
A dream to fly planes, I need to regain the means to be sane

Iâm crazy but shit thatâs fine
Brothers in arms, they here to remind
Iâm reconfigured, raps is bigger
Finger trigger, cash for dinner
Need that money, sky too sunny
Bumpinâ buddy, dollars bloody



With a black lens, I ainât ever lackinâ
Pull up with the back in, just to get some backends
Finna heat the iron like a mothafuckinâ blacksmith
Tell her I ainât lyinâ why you tryna catch me lackinâ
Tell her I dispise the way she mothafuckinâ actinâ
I donât give a damn, spend a check on calamari
And my salmon fuckinâ blackened
 New place, new states
Finna have a new Benz and big plates
Maybe like a new bitch, like every other fuckinâ day
I hope to take my momma out the hood and put her in a wraith



 Off with your head, bruh
Donât talk, poppinâ off like the meds, bruh
Limp walk
Canât stop, on the run from the cops, bruh
On a chase do me dirty for some commas
Dirty for some commas





Say 


Whole time I got the vice grip 
Triggers bustin', niggas duckin', I got theârightâclip
Good manners orâthe damage, a nigga might tip
Iâdrive the boat for the passengers
This a Kodak moment, aâniggaâmightâdrift
I work smarterânot harder, thisâis a life tip
Canât get your show on the road, niggas need a pilot 
You niggas trash still slavin' away on Sylenth
Matter of fact you slaves no matter who niggas sign with 
Lemme look at your deal, 21 Savage
To these Milli Vanilli ass niggas
Donât even own what they rhymin' 


I can't take this livin' all alone, Iâm Phyllis Hyman
Billie Eilish got four GRAMMYs, itâs frightenin'
Slick old nigga, Iâm Peabo Bryson
Flows be so-so, you off key
Rappin' like it's '04, wrote this in Red Monkeys


Uh
Steady hand Peggy, my production is a diamond
Precision, execution, and timin', slick rhymin'
Pick up the pattern, tackle melodies like a lineman 
Rappin' offsides, throw the flag when you fine him
Up in your turf with a bomb and a plan
Flowin' in enemy territory, I feel like Walt White
Teach you niggas how to get busy on USB mics
Rappin' like Schoolly D and dressing like Magnum P.I
She need a tip drill, Peggy been uncut since E.I
All these amateurs, they can't keep up with my stamina 
Ebony, wrong category
You ainât built for what you backin' up
Make your bitch back it up
All these weird beats, you commentin' while Iâm stackin' up
Gots to find new wave, these niggas stay attackin' us
Feel like a Titan when I'm strappin' up, my flow a bachelor
Get to fuckin' on the back of her and get attached to her
Pistol pokin', I look after her, your beats inaccurate
Muddy low end and you over-compressin'
'Cause you donât know what you doin', so you be stackin' it
Donât know the diff' so they just hold and attack it
You impassionate, ungrateful
Mince meat, donât mince words, bitch, I hate you
Thinkin' about what Iâma do and how I'ma do it when I face you


Oh, man, stupid





Called me on the phone
Step it up
Yo


Who gon' hold me down?
Who gon' work my body?
Whoâgon'âtouch me up?
Whoâgon' fuck me in?
Who gon' stickâaround?
Who is worth it? Yeah, yeah
Two things that I learned is I'm worth all the prize
Sugar and spice, everything nice
Who's gonna turn me? Bitches gotta earn me
I'm too hard, oh, oh, huh


He can't be, can't be
I don't want no war
I don't want it with nobody but you
No protection with nobody but you, you, you
I don't want, bodyguard 


Why you wanna? Why?
Why you wanna hurt me babe? 
How you see through my act? 
Please hit me back 
Girl, don't do me like that, you know I want it
I know you want the credit cards, the fancy cars
I know you want the world 
I told your momma I'm comin', I got no refunds
I told your baby it's rented tonight
Who's gonna turn me, bitches gotta earn me
It's too hard, oh, oh, uh, ha


He, yeah, he can't be
I don't want no war
I don't want it with nobody but you
No protection with nobody but you, you, you
Bodyguard





Life is in the moment
And life is incoherent
Life is a thing that you chose to have inherent
You came here for a reason
But you cannot remember it
And you might be frustrated
You might be confused and hyperventilated
Worried about the future
Pull up to the station
Climb up on the crystal express


As we, as we run
Days and starry nights
Pray we'll find a way to the sun
Cause you give me life
Give it all before it's gone
And I'll give you life
Give you everything and more
And you give me life
Is it all we need and want
And I'll give you life
And we all, we all, we all need light


Follow me my brother
Talk to me my sister
We can go wherever
And we can live forever
As we find illumination
Right up on the crystal express
And we can face some problems
Trials and tribulations
Diamonds go through heat and constant pressure for creation
You'll be at your true nirvana
You can ride the crystal express


As we, as we run
Days and starry nights
Pray we'll find a way to be one 
Cause you give me life
Give it all before it's gone
And I'll give you life
Give you everything and more
And you give me life
Is it all we need and want
And I'll give you life
And we all, we all, we all need light







You better run, run from the devil
You better run, run from the devil
You better hide, hide
Hide from the
Hide from the


Young boy
Trying to rule the world I see
Well, young boy
I can give you everything
Diamonds
Everything you touch can be
Golden
But first you gotta listen to me


I'll tell the truth, I promise you
This world may frown upon the things I have you do
But I got taste, and I got style
I know the twists and turns to make your life worth-


Oh na na
Oh na na 
Oh na na
Oh na na


You better run, run from the devil
You better run, run from the devil
You better run, run from the devil
You better run, run from the devil


Oh ya!
Hide from the!


My brother you could probably win in a shit talking competition
My compositions the opposition of all the shit that
Got niggas wishing to spit tragic, the shit that get
You deal crack and you spend cash on cement asses
My heart burns in the fire of truth
Got the heat of seven suns in the meteor treatment needed
More niggas burn on WorldStar than in 1792
Won't act like I'm any better, you or me, I am you
We are hate, we are love, as below so above
We got poison everywhere so what's a war on a drug?
We at war with ourselves, talking war with no guns
So if you had to meet yourself would you go do it or run?
Cause I could be MLK, I could be Juicy J
Or a lame on Instagram that shows the world his AK
Fourty seven's the way, you can follow a stray
At the end of the day, at the end of the day you better-

Run in some type of direction
Cause the people going nowhere are the ones that are flexing
I'm not trying to be a preacher, I was never a reverend
But I can take your ass to church and show you glimpses of heaven you better

Run in some type of direction
Cause the people going nowhere are the ones that are flexing
I'm not trying to be a preacher, I was never a reverend
But I can take your ass to church and show you glimpses of heaven you better


Runnn, run from the devil







I won't compromise
I won't live a life
On my knees
You think I am nothing
I am nothing
You've got something coming
Something coming because


I hear God's whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior

Savior
Savior

Savior 
Savior


We are indigos

Living lives we chose

Show you're brave
Those with faith

On a mission
Led by intuition
You should listen because


I hear God's whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
I hear God's whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
We are the saviors!

Calling my name
We are the saviors!
It's in the wind

You know I see you from afar, right?
Hey, it's alright
Listen, I would've 


There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight


You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it


There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid

"Hey, you got a light?"
"Oh, yes, here you are"
"Thanks, you want a toke?"
"No, no thanks"
"This stuff is getting harder to get"
"Johnny"
"Yeah?"





It just needs that... uh, that uh....
Yeah
Yeah! Okay 
Yeah yeah


Hold  that  light 

Smoke  that  fire 
Hold  that light 
Smoke  that  fire


Baby we can dance if you like
Shake that pretty ass on the flash of the light
Off of one glance, can only imagine the hype
Trying to figure routes to being in your plans for the night
'Cause I haven't felt this good in weeks
Got a fresh cut now I'm looking for the freaks
Fresh car wash, so don't put your hand on the Jeep
Use your etiquette, and bring your own sand to the beach bit
All around the world they keep running
Shawty wanna hold my hand, it ain't nothing
Mariah said if itâs worth time, then say something
And they tell me I'm out of my mind, I ain't budging
Sorry if I'm so overzealous
'Cause I haven't felt no energy like you on this planet
So yeah, put your number in my handheld
And fill that bitches with fan mail, ya dig


Hold  that  light 

Smoke  that  fire 
Hold  that light 
Smoke  that  fire


Really good, nice to meet ya
Maybe we could smoke a little Indonesia
Shake up the world like a geo seizure
Your love song so strong you don't need no features no
Little Jimmy, let's park at last
This cupid never hit me in my heart that fast
I watch it burn whoever start that gas to walk a little
You're either gonna park or crash
It's muscle memory
Walking down a similar path, I feel the energy
Or maybe it's the way I'm feeling from all this Hennessy
I'm way, way bigger than what they tend to be
And you could be my Marilyn Monroe
I'm John Kennedy, you know it
You feel it
'Cause I haven't felt this rhythm in a minute
Gettin' faded until we fall
Got arches, so I hit it
Whether spring, summer or fall
If I want it I'mma get it


Hold  that  light 

Smoke  that  fire 
Hold  that light 
Smoke  that  fire


Now I could turn a pussy to a kiddie pool
And I could swim around until my fingers prune
But if you stick around I'll probably sing a tune
If you stick around I'll probably roll another up right now
Can a nigga groove? 
Come on!


Smoke  that  fire 
Smoke that fire  







My girl got a minimum
Keep it stuck right there 'til the number comes
Leave a smooth operator lookin' like a bum
My girl's got a city to run
Got the key to the kingdom where the money's from
Never seen the color yellow, never seen the sun



Flags flappin' in Manhattan
New Dorp, New York
Gargoyles gargling oil
Peak of the empire, top of the rock

White women singing under diner lights
Baseball bats that never hit home runs

White women singing under dying the lights
The baseball bats never hit homeruns

Yo, yo, yo, you're listening to tobi lou



Be careful what you wish for,âtobi


Damn,âgot it
Iâm tooâhype in the Benz
2014 no rims
D-Wadeâgave this a 10
Bam, bop it, I'm back drivin' again
State license and, passport just came in
France, Scotland, I ainât never been
I've been stuck in USA, I'm an alien 
Came here, immigrant, now I'm, citizen 
Someone, fucked up, now I'm president 
Say she, love me, on the, molly 
Don't believe her, then she, forget me 
Had me, feelin', melancholy 
Follow, me like, Champagne Papi 
Live on, ice like, Sidney Crosby 
Iâve been, workin', on my, body 
We had, sushi, no wasabi 
Rolled a zoobie, then I beat it up like Zazi 


I fell in love with that new G Wagon
Ridin' through your hood with the Gucci blastin'


Stars on my face like Lingo
Killa Cam, Pink Floyd mingle 
24/8 like Reno
24-, 24-, 24-
It was no-, it was no-, it was no-, it was-
It was no accident, I let her go
Back on my dragon and you don't want smoke
Hopped in that Wagon Iâm back on the road
Taking my pics on that camera phone
I'm in a hurry and get it to go
Back on my shit like Benny the Bull
Runnin' the country ahead of the polls
You can't say nothin' 'cause you didn't vote
You don't do nothin' man, you only pose
You only like, maybe retweet
You do not take, the fight to the streets
We had a rally and you were a ghost
My family feel like The Incredibles
I cannot do no more edi-dibles
It got me over here actin' a fool
Chains on my neck like I pity the fool




If I was a soldier 
I'd march to the beat of my own drum 
That soldier  uh
Camouflage shape looking baked
Keep a hun just to blow you 
Into a different state, keep cannons on a taint , daddy told you 
Not to fuck with a soldier

If I was a criminal 
I'd carjack the rich
I'd backslap your bitch
That criminal 
With a frown on my face like a permanent snitch  
The Rolex on your arm with the bezel and the charm
Is that digital?
Give it up, I'm a criminal

If I were you I would
RUUUN!
RUN MOTHERFUCKER!
Just run to your mom straight
RUUUN! 
RUN MOTHERFUCKER!
Just run to your mom straight
RUUUN! 
RUN MOTHERFUCKER!

If I was a mailman 
I'd deliver anthrax in my navy blue pack
That mailman 
I would go postal on a damn spit track
Give 'em hell, man  
You can be penpals with that click-click-pow
That's swell man 
If I was a mailman 

If I was a policeman 
I would aim my barrel at an innocent fellow
That policeman 
Commit a 187 then get off like it never even happened 
My nigga I ain't Mussama
But I don't fuck with pigs with a passion 
Fuck the police, man 

If I were you I would
RUUUN!
RUN MOTHERFUCKER!
Just run to your mom straight
RUUUN! 
RUN MOTHERFUCKER!
Just run to your mom straight
RUUUN!

 This goes out to all the criminals in the world
Put your guns up
Put your index up
Point it to the sky
Cause we got one pointed and they got three pointed back at you
That's suicide

And I know 
You've been watching us  
We've been watching you 
For a long time 
For a long time 
For a long time 
For a long time 
And I know 
You've been watching us 
We've been watching you

Crabs in a bucket


Crabs in a bucket
Wanna see you at the bottom, don't you love it?
When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encore
Sendin' shots but you at the top floor
Let 'em pop shit, give me some drums to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious
If not that then topless, earned all this
Get with that or get in the moshpit
Where's your moxie? Ain't you from Poppy?
Young man, you not actin' too cocky
Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Read a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
If I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put 'em in a bag
Prolly gon' regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet


Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They donât ever want to see the black man eat
Nails in the black man's hands and feet
Put him on a cross so we put him on a chain
Lying to me, sayin' he don't look like me
Rollcage on the GT3
How a show on stage like a DVD?
Put me in the MoMA when it's over with
I used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit


Remember that I still got you
I still got you here
It's rare they'd come across you?
I kept you hidden in my head
Drowning in my own ocean
I forgot to care
And you can drop the anchor, baby
I know what's under there
It never really crossed my mind to think
Maybe you'd avert your glance at me?
Ever really cross your mind
Ever really cross your mind
I ain't never had no chance to breathe





How many trains will make that, yo
Where you can hear a nigga lurking on the street
My nigga, like boom, boom, boom
I'm working on my third, you see
And you still learning about the birds and the bees
My nigga, you knew, knew, knew
We be up all night, just murdering beats
And had the landlord knocking like a burglary
Like boom, boom, boom
They'll bump a nigga 'round the world, you see
And tell me which of you motherfuckers haven't heard of me
Tell me like who, who, who


Started making a name and now they knockin' it
Fuck the city up whenever we droppin' shit
Created a sound, they started jockin' it
Don't put on for the scene, 'cause we not in it
I'm not tryna make a scene
But is it still a scene if it's not heard or seen?
Don't worry about us, nigga, worry about your team
Tryna get this cream 'cause they say cash rules
And you know all of Parker's beats are cashews
Ain't nothin' but a thang, put bass in your- 
Put bass in your voice if you're gonna speak my name
Damn near 30, grown ass nigga
We a dynasty, word to Jigga
Rockin' and I'm rollin', drive it like it's stolen
No sick calls, bro, I always go in
Still bumping Jill, nigga, life is golden


Yo, how many trains will make that, yo
Where you can hear a nigga lurking on the street
My nigga, like boom, boom, boom
I'm working on my third, you see
You still learning about the birds and the bees
My nigga, you knew, knew, knew
We be up all night, just murdering beats
And had the landlord knocking like a burglary
Like boom, boom, boom
They'll bump a nigga 'round the world, you see
And tell me which of you motherfuckers haven't heard of me
Tell me like who, who, who


See, me, I ain't fuckin' with none of that chit-chat
That he-say, she- say shit about this cat
That "Well, I ain't heard he had", nigga, just get back
That old, white nigga saying, "See, I don't do the rap
Thing, but I can actually understand you, I dig that
And you ain't talking 'bout all the guns and you flip crack"
Well, listen up, Baxter, well, see, I get that
But we won't agree on as much as you think, Jack
And then we got the old heads going
"What's up with the ghost-writing thing, my nigga? I don't get that
See, back in my day, you had to write and spit raps"
Isn't Ice Cube writing 6-4 a known fact?
They even put it in a movie, nigga, explain that
That's no shade, they ain't even try go and change that
And here we go back again with all that chit-chat
The he-say, she-say, nigga, just spit raps


Yo, how many trains will make that, yo
Where you can hear a nigga lurking on the street
My nigga, like boom, boom, boom
I'm working on my third, you see
You still learning about the birds and the bees
My nigga, you knew, knew, knew
We be up all night, just murdering beats
And had the landlord knocking like a burglary
Like boom, boom, boom

Tell me like who, who, who





Ain't about me, ain't about me
Gottaâ cook it up, 'cause my niggas hungry
Ain'tâ about me, ain't about me
Gotta cook it up, 'cause my niggas hungry

Nigga, I'm a bitch, how could you tell?
I'm skippin' to the bank, bars age like Pharrell 
They treat me like a dog, whatever fuck this industry 
Pretty in the face, touch my body, call it infantry 
Man, you've been a ho, I'ma guess since infancy 
Only way you get to me is if you put that fuckin' pistol into me
Enemies always movin' goal posts, killin' me
Fuckers wanna finish, but this ain't MK
Put them .30's in the .40's, bitch, let's play this Melee
'Cause when I pull the pistol out, they sing like Ella Mai, Mai 
Because what niggas do be different from what niggas say 
I pistol whip a nigga dressed like I caught the bouquet 
Word to Dot, these crackers wanna hunt me, hold me heart
Thought I would't buss back, bitch, I ain't Rosa Parks 
Sup daddy? Catch me chokin' niggas like Bart
I'm the new Moses, beard to my colon

I do it, I do it
It really don't matter to me dawg


Tom , Varg , Morrissey 
Bunch of timid white ******* who can't fuck with me 
My daddy told me these white ******* can't keep a key 
Fifth in his face, got him singing C 
Never  mind, you or me 
Fuck a Johnny Rotten, I want Lil B 
Fuck you niggas talkin', this a killin' spree 
Pull up on a cracker, bumpin' Lil Peep
God  damn , holy sheet
Got my reparations, bought some jewelry 
Ayy, I'm a left-wing Hades
26 with a fresh .380


We show you exactly how we do it down in the country, baby
This Alabama though, huh


Watch make you go cock-eyed
Racks make you walk wop-sided
And you know I rock real diamonds
You ainât even gotta look at them


F*******, been on my dick, 'cause I'm edgy
Sit ya pale ass down, have a Pepsi, yeah
I'm way past flexing
Feel the dab in my chest, this is venting
Now maybe I'm s-
Okay





We stayed up all night watching the comedy show
That aged whiskey and hydro
Good lord, what a nice conversation
I'm too floored to get anywhere safely
You know I talk about you highly
I'm fascinated for the time being
We can laugh until the morning
Or we can dance in the hallway


Only one more night in Los Angeles
I really thought that I can handle it
But the funny thing is, I was holding back tears
I didn't think this day would happen
I'd give all this up for a chance at it
You would have thought I'd be the man for this
But the funny thing is, we can never stay here
I didn't think this day could happen


But I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over


I'ma ride, I'ma ride
Ride, I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride


And don't all this new music sound the same?
Yeah, we must be getting old and grey
We left early, girl, that band was shitty anyway
We went home and left our clothes up in the living space, aye
Would you stay if your heart had the power?
Would you run and find another life to imitate?
It's important that we make the best of short time
You could never be my one and only, anyway
Say, can't a young man dream?
Can't we all live the life on a widescreen?
What's the point? Yeah
Yeah, we had fun, if only for the time being


But I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over


I'ma ride, I'ma ride
Ride, I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride


I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride it 'til it's over


I'ma ride, I'ma ride
Ride, I'ma ride it 'til it's over
I'ma ride, I'ma ride
I'ma ride, I'ma ride





Been a long time
And I got a lot of things on my mind
Been a whole damn week
If time is money
I ain't gonna spend my time being cheap
No I ain't No I ain't
No I can't for you
I done gone broke spending time with the wrong one
Trying get a lick I thought she sweet like Willy Wonka
I was like a beast always driven by my hunger
Especially when she dropped it low and pick it up like Tonka
The ass too phat
Lord
Extend your hands over the these two eyes
Either the booty is talking to me or im too high
I got too many things to do
I think I'm running out of time


Come on now throwyoassout
Come on Come on don't throw your back out
Baby
Come on Come on now throwyoassout
Come on Come on don't throw your back out
Now bring it back

I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
Time time time


Once upon a time I was talking with Tammy
She said nothing sweeter than the blossom family
I said ya damn right that's an awesome family
Now let your flower bloom on an afternoon

Five hours later I was walking with Tammy
Down Rodeo Drive she was looking so fancy
She said if you love me you would buy me this Louis Vuitton
I said boo I will see you soon
I'm gone
Just as sure as this gap in this song
Trying to penetrate my wallet while your tagging along
I only known for a week
I met you on a tweet
140 characters I think your talk is cheap
You slid in my DMs and said you wanted my physique
I said now girl that's cool I was just looking for a freak
Either the booty is talking to me
Or I'm too high
I got too many things to do I think I'm running out of time




As time goes ticking by I wish we could
Spend a little time
Spend a little time
Just as sure as the wind blows by I know I could
No doubt about it
No doubt about it
But there something not right about the way you move
No no
So I hopped on the right train of thought
Ill see you soon
Ill see you soon
Ill see you Hey



 Dude your a fucking dweeb

I can see the world in your eyes
That's what I told the mirror man, this world full of lies
I'm just starting to see it clearer now
My experiences has grown to make me feel this now
Starting to lose all the doubt I had inside of my spirit now
Maybe I'm dying for this life
All this madness in hindsight is inspiring what I write
Maybe I'm just a fly, getting blinded by this light
Renew my new song like
Cause I can finally buy the price
Maybe quittin', I would hate to say
For the times it wasn't there we had to make a way
Struggle gave me dreams that never take away
Maybe it's a dream that I'm in day to day 
Or maybe I'm just faded, man, ay


Maybe I'm loopy
Maybe I'm stupid
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm going out my mind
Loosely living life
Maybe I'm loco
Maybe I don't know
Exactly what I want
I'll have it before I say goodbye
Just loosely living life
Yeah


Every time I close my eyes
I end up in the Summer skies
Flying over paradise
Yeah, and every time I go to sleep
I end up in a lucid dream
I can do any, I can do anything

And maybe I'm stupid


Sometimes when I wake up
I think - uh-uh
I sit up and wonder
*rambling* every body under
Sometimes when I wake up
I sit up and wonder
Anyone out there
Anyone ever tell about me
*rambling*
Sometimes when I wake up

Let me try that one more time
Can I just listen to it though?






Oh, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Mmm, oh, oh, oh


Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby, I'm down for you, I'm down for you

Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby, I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you


Pulled up to the rita spot where ya girls be at
Told my girl, "Man, I hit your phone, say where your head be at?"
We ain't speak in four or five months, so I'm nervous now
You said that you heard my last shit, so I know you're mad now
Oh man, still that nigga
Uptown with the hittas
Pop a nigga like we pop a wheely
Niggas goin' crazy in the city
If we do it, show up in the city
Just did that instead of rockin' with me
Always keep it so one thousand with ya
Always down to run a mountain for ya


Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Baby, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Said baby, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side

Super fake with the hoes now
Countin' money with the bros now
G starrin' from a Benz
Lick, lick, lick, lick with the scope now
Skrrt, skrrt in the coupe 
Ask a shawty what it do? 
I ain't really mean to fall in love with a hood bitch, but it's you


I will be right by your shoulder, babe
And when the weather gets colder

Said you should know that I'm right there

Whenever the sun don't shine on the west side
You know I'm sitting pretty right by your side
Said baby I'm down for you, down for you
I'm down for you, down for you, down for you





This slack-jaw mealy-mouth
I mumble when I'm 'round the house
I'm trying not to do no chores today
Crying in my underwear
I lost my sense of wonder there
No, I'm not Milan Kundera
Though this lightness is unbearable
The feeling is indelible
I'm wishing I could teleport somewhere
Transmolecularize through the secular eye
I remember when Vegeta stomped Bardock's neck in
Two prayer hands to the heavens, good Lord, bless Him
I was a broke slob watching Ghost Dog writing Post Hoc
If I could muster just one good throat chop
And honor my shidoshi, 'cause 'dim mak' means 'death touch'
I been Spock, I been clutch
In thin socks, I'm butthurt
Impervious pervert with niggerish fervour
Crashing Linux server
Who didn't even change his laundry over
Who needs to buy toilet paper
Indie rapper, sorta faker
'Cuz I couldn't afford a mortgage or a Studebaker
'Cuz I couldn't afford a mortgage or a Studebaker


When you're deep in the raw
Everybody wants to get a piece of your heart
There's only so much truth you can keep in your bowl
Speak your piece, but words are too harsh


Overspoke my piece
I'm known in the streets
When you're deep in the raw
There's only so much truth you can keep in your jaw

I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world


Every song responds to a threat
Every laundered dollar is wet
But if a momâs like a song torn breath
But as long as I can ponder the depth
And the king sorta stinks of lunacy
I roam the rinks in sync with the jinx that are having me sink the moon and the sea
Bankers clink drinks as they uplink to the sphinx's coonery
I'm on the brink, I could fill my sink with the king's jewelry
Yeah, who is he? Driverâlion from a dead world
Sole practitioner of his customs and know the RPM of your head twirl
Driver old as fuck
My daughter old enough to vote
Rap songs blowing up on the coast
Loyal subjects rolling up that smoke
As I dictate terms from an ensnarled perch
Yeah, and Leimert Park is Winterfell
Rumors I learn to Splinter Cell and pitches sale from Mike's Citadel
Exact an explicit Hell
Empty the fire and sway
My music on Pirate's Bay as my elusive alliances fray
I collude with a silent clay and infuse a vibrant day
With a soothing eye in decayâputting food on the dining tray
Yeah, I can do this my way
Welcome home


When you're deep in the raw
Everybody wants to get a piece of your heart
There's only so much truth you can keep in your bowl
Speak your piece, but words are too harsh


When I was a younger man
I could feel the entire world
But now that I'm older...


When you're deep in the raw
There's only so much truth you can keep in your jaw

I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world

When you're deep in the raw
There's only so much truth you can keep in your jaw

I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world

Too much heat, you can't call for no cops
Too much filmin', you seem like an opp
Fuck the underground, I'm goin' pop
Only Mandy Moore played in this drop
More hits than the Four Tops
Hairline like a Ford, tough, stretch
Rappin' like I signed to Koch 
Eatin' ass head to toe in this gold
Can't nobody touch me, I feel like Fort Knox 
I'm outta my class, digital dash
Modern-day Cannibal Ox


This sound fine as it is, you know what I mean?
Whatever, whatever
Say

'Cause he don't know my name like The Ting Tings
Chuck Berry, big strap, that's my ding-ling
Really come from the heart when I sing tings
Finna get this bitch shaking like jingling
R.I.P. Bernie Mac, legend in the game
R.I.P. Bernie Mac
When I die, hope my music gives cowards pain
Pray Allah, Christ, and Buddha, you'll never be shamed
Lil' kids gonna inherit this fame
E-plus my celebrity name, I'ma tell you now
If I go plat', best believe, lil' bitch, that Peggy gon' change
Y'all better pray I stay in my lane
Never switch my ideals for position or fame
If you do dirt, keep it quiet like Pootie Tang
Lose it all for the nut like Louis C.K.
Gag order on him, we ain't tryna be civil
Ho, I'm aimin' for your head like Martin Luther King
Shoot at your tour bus, we gon' increase your streams
Big strap like Portia de Rossi, I know

Quicksand's 
Too thick to stand 
Figure out now what it is that you need

One set of footsteps in the sand, but I'm not being carried
If it gets out of hand, you can go on without me





Excuse me, sir 
Your Grace
Is that my flamethrower beside you? 
Please, sir, pass it this way
Can you hand me that pistol over there?
Please don't get muffins on it

Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche

Itâs tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown

Got âem hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppinâ the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of yo face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year?
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee


I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown 
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown


Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
The poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, G.O.A.T.â
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God


You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put the knee in horny
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattooed on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend 


I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown 
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown





Edsclusive
Just another day in these filthy sweet Atlanta streets
Back on a greenback hunt
One for theâmoneyâand two forâthe loot
You want to run withâbulls? Best tie your shoe
I make all your dreams and nightmares come true
I've got all that I want, now Iâve got you


Now get back on your feet like giraffe, elephant, kangaroo
Can't come through these 'partments
âLess you cool, 'less you know the who's who 
You're in my world now, I make the rules
I say who lives, I say who dies
I save the kids, I push the button
Delete the crew, call me John Q
Call me Olu 


Bitches, I've arrived 
Feelin' on a high, flexinâ in the sky
Make whoopy, make way for the motherfuckinâ guy
Alright? 
Well, alright


See, I go loco for my freedom 
Itâs the only thing that's real these days
No fear, no shame, matter fact, let's get this straight
I ain't no rapper 
See, triumph comes from dyinâ
Some enjoy come from cryin'
Sometime healin' come from killin'
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, there I go
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, never fold
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, there I go
Rich shit, nigga shit, climb on up, never fold

Got it, said, I'm up
Ah-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Said, I'm up 


Okay, roll the dice
Baby need a new pair of shoes, famous overnight?
Nigga, these people don't care 'bout you, came up in the jungle
Gotta bail my partners out the zoo, what's the price of love?
Can't think about that, my taxes due
I roll the dice
Baby need a new pair of shoes, famous overnight?
Nigga, these people don't care 'bout you, came up in the jungle
Gotta bail my partners out the zoo, what's the price of love?


Okay, look
Paid dues, no more fake news
I'ma do everything that they said that I can't do
Miss me with that artificial
Baby, I ain't fooled by the filters or the angles
You don't know yourself, when you come into some wealth
You the type to let it change you
All I'm sayin', make money, don't let money make you
Muhfucka love to talk about all they ever wanted, like it ever mattered
While the opps sit back and collect the data
Oh, I bet you thought yo' ass was educated
Oh, I bet you thought that you escaped the master
Lyin' to yourself, you the greatest actor
Round of applause, round of applause
Gemini's two-faced, Cancer got claws
Life is a cartoon I did not draw
I'm takin' hiatus, word to Nai Palm
Always had a certain je ne sais quoi
Pull up on your bitch like, "Excuse my French"
Fuck what you thought
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Ce-soir, I take no days off
Ain't no problem that I can't solve, what you made of, huh?


Yeah, I'm up
You pussies thought that I was down?
No, no, no, yeah I'm up
I got it, got it, I got it, got it, I got it, got it
Got it, said, I'm up
Ah-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

That's all I wanna do
Ayy, yo


Bucket hat like I'm Gilligan
Hit Wallace, I just ordered aâCullinan
Milkin'âthe cow, whatâare you niggas uttering?
Churning the butter,âsensitive niggas crying
Stepping in puddles in them new 
The team I'm assembling, you trembling
We in a circle huddling, fumble and we coming in
Tackling your empire, it's Robert crumbling
One nom'? Huh, shit is humbling
I'm a fucking jumbotron, juggernaut
You a G? No, you're not
New balloon, watch it p-
Concave on a skateboard
Don't do surfboards, I don't ride waves
Been around forever, Murray's Pomade, nigga
Been like a decade, yeah, haha, uh, ayy, yo


Keep it buck, I switch it up
You niggas don't, that's why you stuck
I needed seven figures, hit Australia, pick it up
Find some young twink and get my nipples sucked
Bad yellow bitch look like pimple pus
Bad chocolate bitch look like Lionel knuckles
Y'all got too much baggage and I pack light, Louis trunk
Luggage double C, emeralds double V
Uni tee, but the sweater vest is me
Lemonade, elderflower with the rose
Sony re'd up, I'ma split it with the bro, yeah
Yeah


Niggas like, "Act your age, T, you trippin'"
Pushin' thirty, but the skin say different, well
If I act my last deal, I'm probably twelve
I put some niggas on, nigga set a lob
Then they hurt theyself, niggas Cheddar Bob 
Foot is on the gas, I ain't letting off 
Every car is gas, pissing Greta off
And they Group B and the leather soft
And I knew the cow, and he better off dead


One take

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


That nigga back from the dead, yeah
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Nigga almost lost his head, yeah
Try to run, try to fly, try to float
Candles on top of the dresser
Baby, you down, need to bless up
Better watch how you address us
Playing no games, no dress-up
I got an idea
Let's shoot Wild 'N Out in my hood, talkin' right here
Academy Award-nominated performance, yeah
Let the AK spray straight for four minutes, yeah
That's a monologue, talking to the fog, fuck an ordinance, yeah


I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat, rabbit's toe, I suppose
Maybe that's what life is


Ayy, man, cavemen
Two drinks, cave in
Few blunts, ease up
Ooh yeah, please up
Who cares? Who there?
Do what? Wake up
The hell, heaven
We want, heads up
Hey you, yeah, you
Mother fuck, brother fuck
Sister fuck, family fuck
The system, get some
Hey you, day two
Yeah, you, you, you
You a vege', do the dance
Table, get low
Chopped cheese, knot knees
Boy, please, whatever
You next, to death
To go, ooh, oh
Who's that? Ring ring
Your number, bling-bling
Call it up, chalk it up
Move over


I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat, rabbit's toe, I suppose


See a nigga in all red from the North with the pole
It ain't Santa Claus
Brought my gifts to Atlanta, I'm Atlanta Claus
I can smell you pussy with the panties off, I
Been gettin' to the bread, tryna keep this shit low
But it ain't workin', my
Circle on fire like a circus now
Around the same niggas I been around, so
Of course, I , endorse my 
Ratchet ass nigga from the North Side 
It's astigmatism, you got poor sight 
Let the bitches forget it, I do it Alzheim'
Of course I , gotta voice my 
Opinion on that ass when you walk past

Niggas pull strings like a guitar, guitar
G-Star jeans on my sneakers
I'm a real soulful nigga, collard greens inside your speakers 
Ferguson days on Castro, wasn't no cash flow
But I'm good for the arch, I'm Dr. Scholl's
I'm good for your heart, let me snatch your soul, soul, soul


Bloody sacrifices


Yeah, ayy
Look at what a motherfucker do for the cash intake
They'll be right across your head like it's Ash Wednesday
You got to just get off your ass like your ass is fake
You can't sit, and if we ain't siblings, then I can't relate
To they shit, I'm Asic, I run shit, I got it jumpin' like pump fake
I don't need nothing but one take
I'm from the part of the city where young nigga keep him a nine like one plus eight
Our politician a fuckface
Corrupt like a Dogg Pound Gangsta
We duel like a small town wager
How I'm the dropout major
Success stories, I favor
Used to cover my scars, out here tryna cover The Fader
Yeah, Pro Tools, knobs, and the faders
Tell pigs as-salamu alaykum
You ain't 'bout static like AM radio, ain't even play him
I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate
All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days
I thought I'd call 'em out altogether
Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name
Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you
Via the studio, got 'em studying our mixtapes
I'm from the hood like my mama, put that on my mama
I lay the law down like parliament, all just with a pen and page


I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices


You can't be everything to everybody
I wanna be your lover, your best friend
Your Batman, Spider-Man
Fighter pilot shooting down your rivals and
I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
I wanna be the one that feel you up
On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
I wanna be the one to build you up
A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
Pull you under
Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble
We done moved out to the boondocks
Built a big house, there he wonders
How somewhere along the way
He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
Say something crazy, they won't interject
Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
I be havin' to check myself
Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
I be havin' to spread my wealth
I used to be at the crib myself
7 years old, off of Bragg Boulevard
Where they bag up the raw
They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star
And I ran into you like I met you before
Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing


Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey


And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to
And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to


I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices





"Ladies and gentlemen, lions, tigers and bears, giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all that shit. I am Jazze Phenzel Burgandy Obama Luther King Jr. Jackson 5 the First, and I'd like to introduce to you Block Hemzell, AKA BLOCKHAMPTON! Oh, boyâladies and gentlemen!"


My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la


Thirty-two hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries


I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow


My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la


Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you canât renounce me
Like la, la, la, la


Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie, whoop!


My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la, la, la, la


Thirty-two hundred on the

Yuh, yuh


She was a fan, but her friend didn't care
I like the ones who buy they own damn beers
If you wanna toast to the life that you live
Pour enough shots for the whole year
Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair
Matte black Jeep with the Rubicon grill
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, don't go there
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, come here


Shaped like pear, baby, jet black hair
You bought the drinks and I paid no care
Hold a nigga down, don't go nowhere
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, come here


We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me


Yuh, yuh
We goin' in there from the window sills
I don't mind if they watch, I don't care
Who gon' love you when your love ain't there?
Baby, that ass is just unfair
Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair
At least two grams in your blunt wrapped there
These two hands always land up on the small of your back
Should I ask if eyes can go there?


You bought the drinks and I paid no care
Couple more shots, we can all get to bed
Yes, Lord, like you livin' on a prayer
Play too much, baby, come here


We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me 
We peakin'


If this is the mood, then you should know
I have to be honest, I love it
We peakin'
If this is the mood, then you should know
I have to be honest, I love it
We peakin'


And the coldest part is I'm not even there
I watch your feed, but I don't feed into that
Just give me the news
I miss all the parties, but I'm still the best dressed, clean
As the curtain on him pulls back


Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone liftin' me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
We peakin'





You should've been downtown 
The people are rising 
We thought it was a lockdownâ
They opened theâfire 
Them bullets was flyin' 
Whoâsaid it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie 


It's aâwarâgoingâon outside, Iâswear to God
I'mâon the front line, no front, no cap, no fun-size
Sunshine, cinnamon skin
People blend in together and ride side by side, organized
We bust guns at the same time, harmonize 
Form a line, pick a lead, take a leap
Lead with love, please, you sound like Dr. King
People tired of taking beatings from beasts covered in sheets
I love niggas, but we too forgiving for how they treating us
Reparations, bit', we tryna get even
Just run the paper maybe, then we can start the conversation
Common ground, prison compounds full of my fuckin' people
How you still sleepin'? Have you had your coffee this evening, Karen?
'Cause you seem a little off
All the black girls missin' and endin' up inside the coffins
But you mad when they hashtag "BlackLivesMatter" on front your sidewalk
Diabolical thoughts, diatribe from dialogues
Damaging images of men and women who died off
Fighting for civil rights, a simple necessity
Given when you given life, but we been trippin'? Right 


You should've been downtown 
The people are rising 
We thought it was a lockdown 
They opened the fire 
Them bullets was flying 
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie



Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it


Uh, maybe this round two
Government cinematic, American drive-thru
Eat their apple pie in the morning then bury the strange fruit
Then marry the strange fruit and call it the Black love
So when he bleeds, I bleed, the sacred riddle
Ain't no money I can make to make the cops get little
We seen 'em murder the indigenous, the Passage Middle
The Constitution, a life for a bag of Skittles
So when we bleed, I load the sacred pistol
And if you need, I'll read Assata with you
And if you rich, I pray that God forgive you
Supposed to share the garden, grow the Holy in you
Maybe everything is a metaphor, one God
An African liberation is ready to take arms
They telling you, "Stay calm," they double-barrel the shotty
And stand on a graveyard and tell you to slave on


Downtown 
The people are rising 
We thought it was a lockdown 
They opened the fire 
Them bullets was flying 
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie 


Turn on your tube, dawg, look how they do us
Knee on our necks, bullets in backs, stimulus checks
Strictly for Blacks? History repeating
People scared to eat a chicken, everybody going vegan
What they put in it?
Look at the world we living in, they got us shook in it
You go on your jog, then your color might get you took in it
Man in the mirror, don't look away, you better look at it
Black lives matter, so what it means when they shoot at it?
Generation, genocide, what happened to enterprise?
Heard the man infiltrated, Black Panther, re-energize
Nothin' to figure out, they tryna kill us out
If I take a kneel, see my fist, I'm a killer now?
Just think, bullshit you gotta filter out
Are you really ready for the smoke like a Swishahouse?
Ready for the revolution, who ready to ride?
It won't be televised, so tell me, who ready to die?
Know the difference from a 'pan' and a 'plan'demic
Just a bunch of bullshit, how we land in it?
You either fall for anything or you stand in it
It's a lot going on on this damn mission
Big B.G. used to sell microchips
Now he out here pushing vaccines?
It's 'bout to be another lockdown
Feelin' like D.C., fuck you mean?


Downtown 
The people are risin' 
We thought it was a lockdown 
They opened the fire 
Them bullets was flyin' 
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie 


Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now , I'ma shoot it
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown


Citizens of Los Angeles

Let me get down!


You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile


C'mon, uh
Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it with a big bat though
Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll


You, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on

It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile


Before Vietnam, when boards were long and hair were short, the center of the surfing world was a place called Malibu







Yeah, yeah, okay,âhmm


Sometimesâyou need aâfriend
Not the ones that just showâup and don't put nothin' in
You know the ones that lend a hand and wanna see you win
When you come up on a lick, make sure you cut 'em in
And then, huh
Sometimes you need a foe 


One that keep your eyes open, keep you on your toes
You know the ones that wanna keep you where you been before
But I can't go , no, I can't go 
And woah, huh
Sometimes I need a check 
Not the sneakers but the ones that make you watch your step 
Fuck your chain, fuck your name, how 'bout your respect?
Givin' more than what I get, expectin' nothing back
In fact 


You know I sat down with my accountant
He said, "I got good news and I got bad news" 
I said, "What's the good news?"
He said, "The good news is you made a lot" 
I said, "What's the bad news?"
"The bad news is you spent more"
Okay, oh, shit, look


Huh, sometimes you need the faith 
Sometimes you need to know your worth, sometimes you need to wait 
Shoot like the Golden Boy, but ain't from the Bay 
You can't negotiate with Dre, you gon' have to pay 
But wait 
Juggin' on the main stage, fuckin' up the main frame
Loosen up your face, baby 
Sometimes I need a vacay 
Meditate, hydrate
Protect my energy before engagement 



Grew up havin' nothing, you're labeled impatient 
But once the boss made it, you labeled amazin'
Meticulous with words, that's your force of nature 
I don't wanna seem absurd, but that boy's a gangster
Foc-focusin' on me, way from Tel-Aviv 
Barbados with the hustle, pockets Elandis 
Distinctive destinations all I wanna see 
Oceanfront residences, three different ones a week
'Cause I deserve that , it's time to learn that 
Mess around and put that thing up where your perm at 
Six figures every year, yeah, I earned that 
At the front of this line is where my turn at, huh



Sometimes you need a friend 
Not the ones that just show up and don't put nothin' in 
You know the ones that lend a hand and wanna see you win 
When you come up on a lick, make sure you cut 'em in 
And then 
Sometimes you need a foe 


Oh
Men gon' lie , women gon' lie 
You lookin' for the truth, then the numbers don't hide 
Lookin' for the root of all evil, then you need to go
Open up the briefcase, see it with your eyes 
Everybody claim to be greatest of all times
But they never spend a day in the rain in the front line 
Uh, stop playin' on my phoneline
Shoot, lock and load, pull up in the space coupe
With the roof optional, wonder why they follow suit
I've been groomed from the womb, came out of my mama coochie
With some brand new tennis shoes, faster than the speedin' bullet


Nah, nah, nah, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool 
Say what you gon' do with that 
Turn around, if you don't do it now 
Exactly, yeah, 'cause you're not built like that
It's not a game





Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' show off, gon' show off
Get right with me, right with me


You could be a chosen one
Kiss me with your native tongue
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Miss me 'til the mornin' come
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Oh, oh, oh


Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' show off, gon' show off
Get right with me, right with me


You could be a chosen one
Fuck these niggas, all of them
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Kiss me 'til you make me cum
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Oh, oh, oh, oh


Uh
Can't get enough, look at that
Make you walk, pistol grip on
From the kitchen to the livin' room
To label me as the one, debatable
But second to none, that suit me like a tailored suit
And a nigga up, up like Sailor Moon
Brought a totally different energy up in the room
Heard your fans want to keep you in the underground, cool
When I blow up, said I did it for MF DOOM
No cap, no cap
I keep it one hundred, blowin' hundreds at The Beverly
All facts, all facts
Go look for another and come back and say you'll never leave
Your neck, your back
I could bust it open, super soaker, make the pussy leak
I could break it down and put it back together properly
I know what you want and I know what you need


We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be lovin' each other crazy 
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our... are through

We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to





Check, check, check
Check, check
Check, will you turn the beat up?
Brr
Oh, mmm, check, check, could youâturnâmy vocals up?
Yeah,âmmm, mmm
Brr
How could you not know?
Whatâyou meant to me
You and me are gonna be aâbit

I'll be upâin a minute
Brr, brr, brr 
Thank you, fuck you 
Fuck you , fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, thank you 


I think Iâm insane, do you love me?
I think I just came, do you trust me?
When I stare hard, you get ugly
I just look away at the money
I donât come from money but they say I look expensive
He lay me on the table with a bag 'cause Iâm his pension
If you with me you wonât go hungry 
If you ain't me, call me mommy
Fuckin' with the ghost in my body
Pray to the pussy let it calm me
Stretch marks on my skull, I wasnât made for me at all
Cut me open with your jaw, lick the writing on the wall
I got a fat mouth, no collagen
I got a fat cat  and my throat infinite 
 He want a picture with Tommy
Save that shit like JPEG
She wanna know whoâs Mommy?
Blood pact, wolf pack, hashtag
She put a gun to my halo
I talk to God and He calls me emo
He put a tongue to my halo
I talk to God and She calls me emo


You know, you know 
Get up, get up
Stay up, get up, get back, we know
Got it, then I say no, say no
You think you know me
Look 


Some of my friends got big dreams 
Some of my friends tote big beams 
None of your friends get no cream 
These niggas look blank, got no theme 
Just got a new MAC, that's fifteen 
Young bald head nigga, I'm Mr. Clean
Caught a nigga off guard like Pistol Pete 
Light a square nigga up like Billie Jean 
Just got a new grill, but I can't eat 
But I gotta feed my motherfuckin' family
Gotta make it to the top and get a GRAMMY 
But I be playin' with the drums like a band geek 
Bitch nigga, donât make me aggy
Dome shot, now you look like Cassie 
Skinny nigga, but Iâm built like a athlete 
AR same colors as khakis
You my sons but I donât be the pappy
Stop wastin' my time 
These niggas done ran outta line 
Iâm strapped but I'm ready to die 
I feel like a thot when I cry 
I feel like a God when I rhyme 
I canât believe that he ainât signed 
Why?


No, the other
And if it doesn't fit me I'll give it back to you





Spark, she don't ever spark
She don't ever stress me
We don't even fuck
She don't ever spark

When we have drugs

I got lost up in it, got lost up in it, got high for a minute 
Said my lust for life and these lights are bright and I love these women
Said we bopping slow and we do the dance like we more than winning
Said she off the beat but sheâs fine as fuck so I find the rhythm
No love is greater, in this whole world we made up
This love is made-up, itâs made-up
Itâs made-up, itâs made-up, itâs made-up 
I donât know this bitch but I love this shit and we both feel splendid
And she loud as fuck so I grab and touch and she donât get offended
They gon' call the law if we donât get lost in  parking lot
She donât like me dog, she just like the drugs my nigga, donât get it twisted


How many more can you give to me?
How many more can you give to me?
I know youâre feeling me
Grinding and biting and kissing me
Who gives a fuck bout your history?
Nobody mentioned it
I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog
Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ainât in love


She donât give a fuck

I donât know your name I just love that ass, and Iâll pulled up on it
Said I hate the club, but I make the club when I walk into it
Said you hate the drink, but you take the drink when I offer fluid
No love is greater, in this whole world we made up
This love is made-up, itâs made-up, itâs made-up, itâs made-up, itâs made-up
I can say right now that Iâll lay you down, I got lots of rubbers

Yes lawd!





Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola 
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over 
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
SanterÃ­a 


They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate 
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets 
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in 
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
SanterÃ­a!


Ya te vas a la maÃ±ana 
Ha-ah, los Ã¡ngeles te esperarÃ¡n
Es el fuego que yoâconozco
Es el fuego que yoâ
Ya te vas a la maÃ±ana 
Ha-ah, los Ã¡ngeles te esperarÃ¡n
Es el fuego que yoâconozco
Es el fuego que yoâ


Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays
SanterÃ­a!


Ya te vas a la maÃ±ana 
Ha-ah, los Ã¡ngeles te esperarÃ¡n
Es el fuego que yoâconozco
Es el fuego que yoâ





Yeeaaaa Yea
Do do do do doo doo doo do do


Even when the sun don't shineâyouâdo
You take awayâmy grace as I make aâmove
Even if I fell that height I can't deny


The sunâwillâalwaysâshine so brightâwith you
The sunâwill always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you


I said I like how you make me feel
I said your love is so surreal
I said I like how you make me feel
I said your love is so surreal
I said I like how you make me feel
I said your love is so surreal
I said I like how you make me feel
I said your love is so surreal


Like how you make me feel
Love is so surreal
Like how you make me feel
Love is so surreal


The sun will always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you
The sun will always shine so bright with you










Yeah


When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you


If you don't know me by now, I don't want you to
None of your favorite rappers ever tell the truth
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, out of my mind
It's about damn time y'all startin' to die
Lay low, I'm the ghost at your window
Went away, now I'm way away
There he go, fuck an icon, eyes on A.I.
Oh, I fucked around and put a pipe bomb in your radio


A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
A.I., A.I., A.I. 


A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
 A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.
 A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.


I don't wanna be the one to bear the bad news
But a man who's claiming he's the man ain't a man at all
Overcompensating for the lack of ability
To really be an icon, not even a bygone
Modern-day unsustainable, painfully mundane
Forgettable, gets old in a minute
Get sold to a label then never 


I spend all my time listening to guys who committed suicide
It's about time, it's about time
And I only ever really cry
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
I only ever cry
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
And I only ever cry
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
To wash away


Don't give a damn 'bout a critic, they don't really get it
They don't make a difference, they don't buy the tickets, ah
Only really give a damn 'bout the kids
Live and die for the kids, live and die for the kids, ah


A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
 A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.
 A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.
 A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.
 A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.,  A.I.


I only ever really
I only ever really
To wash away all the blood





I can't find nobody to love me back
Every time I breathe, it's heart attack
Smoke in my lungs, please, fight for my country
Fucked up my money 
I can't find nobody to slow me down
Every time that they try, I can't be found
Fucked up my cuff links, die for my country
Why don't you want me 
I can't find no reason to not stay, I
Every time I try, it's suicide
Feels like I'm falling, can't hear you calling
Your words still harm me


I'm bawling 
Tears got me bawling
Money got me bawling
My eyes been bawling
President keep falling
My fate still stormy
You should be cautious
Like yellow tapÐµ, keep caution
Don't hit the brakes too often
I'm so damn Ðµxhausted
I pull up on you like marksmen
Like Logo man in Portland
Please don't leave me open
I see green like Boston
She wet like a dolphin
My head filled with endorphins
My head filled with endorphins




Is it real? Is it real? Does it feel real-real?
Does it feel real-real? Really real? 


I'm cold like Steve Austin
I'm out here defrosting
I feel like I'm hot now
I'm heating up, I'm scorching
Don't put 'em on me, I torch 'em
I'm mighty, I'm morphing
Knew I was that nigga back in kindergarten
She got so much knowledge so I just absorb it
She always got a phone out, told her no more recording
The twenties came in this bitch, they came in roaring
Take me back to a time when Kobe was still balling
'Cause now I'm just


Bawling 
Tears got me bawling
Money got me bawling
My eyes been bawling
President keep falling
My fate still stormy
You should be cautious
Like yellow tape, keep caution
Don't hit the brakes too often
I'm so damn exhausted
I pull up on you like marksmen
Like Logo man in Portland
Please don't leave me open
I see green like Boston
She wet like a dolphin
My head filled with endorphins
My head filled with endorphins







Aw, niggas really done some shit
Stay calm, please remain calm
Apology-zoned
Huh, heat zone
I am alright
I buildâtheâroom
I rule theâroom
Don't feel better
Huh, huh, huh, woah
Allânight, all day, hah
Aw, man 


I wanna rock your world, I wanna be your girl
You wanna take me out yeah, yeah, take me out, huh
They ain't never take me down, bitch 
They ain't never take my crown, bitch

Hate? Never, bitch, where? Uh


Bruh, put the keyboard down, get the MAC out
Blackout, make a motherfucker back out, back 
G's up, freeze when I put her down
I'm pullin' up on this pussy and I'm pullin' out
Rock bottom when I put... 
You it, those clowns
Switch your pitch when I hit the mound
Rap niggas think they so profound
Got 'em lookin' up like who they under now? 
I ain't underground
Bitch, I'm over who you under now, sucker
Hope you had the time of your life
'Cause it's over for you when I come around 
Thot tactics
Your shit don't bump, you was not proactive
Sneak dissin', that is not attractive
I'm in a slump and I'm bouncin' back
Bitch crash whips like burnout
Pussy nigga, how you end up caught in traffic?
Chrome ratchet, case basket
With white shooters like the old Mavericks, it's real
Just in case you thought it wasn't



I, I, I wanna rock your world, I wanna be your girl
You wanna take me out yeah, take me out, huh
They ain't never take me down, bitch
They ain't never take my crown, bitch, no


I can't compete 
I'ma do you like **** did me 
No 'pologies 

Sucker nigga, put the keyboard down, get the MAC out
Blackout, make a motherfucker back out
G's up, freeze when I put her down
Pullin' up on this pussy and I'm pullin' out
Rock bottom when I'm puttin'...
Nigga 





Uh
Someone made a mess in my account 
Someone bought a Patekâinâa panic 
Bode, Bentley addict, I go manicâ
Hit the oochie-coochie 'til it's slanted, ooh
I'm gon' beat it up, ooh, lady
I'm gon' make your dreams come, baby
Ayy, you the one who talkin' all that trash 
Forty-five, I'll twenty-eight that ass 
You can set the snow on fire 
You smell like a peach papaya
She said, "Eat this psilocybin, I'ma be right back"
I'm like, "Aight" 
"Ayy, I don't know what psilocybin is" 
"This better not be no molly"
She just laughed and closed the door
Dark chocolate, sea salt
I took a bite
She said, "We gon' have a special night" 
I said, "Who you telling, girl? I know that"
Tracee Ellis with it when you throw back 
Girl, I see your 
Ooh, you're so divine 
And them panties came off 
I'ma give you some privacy 
Pictures with your stepsisters 
N. K. Jemisin with you, uh
Got the All About Love, on some bell hooks
Then I turned to a dirty look, uh 
Ayy, why your cat lookin' at me sideways?
"Sing to her"
I said, "Nah, I'll put on the radio though"

Lay back on my back , vibrate
My ex on some BS
She walked out the closet
Girl, never write a check I can't deposit
She said, "Boy, stop, let's go walkin'" 
"You wanna be outside for this"
We just talkin'
Dogpark looking like a Trader Joe's 
Papillon, mmh, thought you hated those
Other girls, uh, let they shady show
Every time we walk around
They say, "How she gonna hold him down?" No
They don't know what they missing
Most these niggas wanna run around with these SZAs 
I prefer to just stroll the park with this Chaka
Baby girl was just diggin' all in my pockets 
I was going hard 
We were holdin' hands, tried to make me understand 
Make girls fall in love, that's my , yes
Everybody's jealous I won't ease it with these colors
Ooh, I wanna see it in the moonlight
Yellow, red, orange robe, askin' for donation 
I'm not a tourist, nigga, this is not vacation 
Vibrate
Goddamn, man, this girl goin' crazy on my Motorola
She said, "Let me answer it" 
Then she'll know it's over 
Girl, you cancerous, you gon' ruin my life
Let me get this paperweight, then come be my wife
She just laughed and touched my face 
You don't understand what this is 
I ain't lookin' for another lifetime
Let's just stay here and enjoy the great design
Had the iceberg tucked in my waist 
Fuck an omelet, you can eat off my face 
I just thought that we were vibin'
You don't love her, then you lyin'
Come and go and you get tulips
Put a finger to my two lips 
Ooh, you got it bad, just remember what we had
You can set the snow on fire
The reason that you suffer is desire 
The reason that I'm moving with this ooh-wee
I was lovin' life, I got too deep 
Woke up in my room, she was long gone
Toni singing me another sad song 
Eternity
Oh, until we meet again


This ain't special, tell me what you want
This ain't special, baby, this is fun
This ain't special, tell me what you want
This ain't special, baby, this is fun


Drop it off , let me see if your booty soft
Gold mouth , yes, I'm from the Dirty South
Lights out , summertime, I brought the ice out 
Pipes out , all my shooters came from Moscow
Got a girl in Harvard, I talk proper when I call her 
Baby, I'm a baller, ain't no way that I can raw ya 
She don't want no new friends, she just tryna buy her a new Benz 
I've been counting M's, me and Ben Franklin damn near kin 
Put my mind to it and I did it, them facts 
Talkin' 'bout your brother to get some pussy, that's wack 
The police keep harassin' 'cause I'm rich and I'm black 
They mad 'cause I made myself a boss without crack 
I ain't trippin', boy, I'm Lamborghini whippin' 
Straight up out the trenches, money made me ign'ant 
I'm on a private jet eatin' Popeyes chicken 
I be flexin' like I'm eatin' Popeye's spinach 


Morning dew
Percolating, still have a little time for Sunday, ooh 

Baby, I might let you go
Babe, baby, no matter what
And like I switch the other side of me
Baby got a whole lotta ride on me
Babe, baby, let's take it back to crib
Back, back to the crib
Back, back to the, babe
I might let you go
Baby, baby, no matter what
And I can, I can, I can, I can
To the crib
Back to the crib, back to the
And no one seen them
Baby, I, baby, baby, I

Music biz don't give no pat on the back, ugh
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up 
Pack it up, pack it up, woah, hold on, man
Grown, live at the Days Inn
My appetite made me nauseous 
They thinkin' Tinder with the topic 
I take the wins out with the losses
You see me grippin' with the gossip
Now I'm eating dinner with the bosses
I hit the vape because it's needed 
I fall asleep like Tempur-Pedic
Got a light, got a light, got a light, I'll be there
They kill my niggas for no reason
I hear 'em


These bullets coming at you
Take these bullets for me, that's my grimy waifu 
They keep on dumping the tool

Police, they beat me, we storm the same streets
We stormâtheâsameâblock, won't stopâ'til we free
Ain'tâthink it was possible, âtil we accomplished it
Now we accomplices, now we all poppinâ shit
I'm gettinâ money, the kids gettin' money
I'm droppin' racks and racks  in church on a Sunday
I get it back to back, go to work on a Monday
White on white tracksuit, âcause you know who run it
We was hungover, South Beach was too sunny 
We out in Joburg, no sleepers, we clubbin'
Catch me out in Europe with my black skin
Fightin' for freedom, my nigga, ain't no more askin'
Judge ain't never forget him for when he was trappin' 
And that pussy wet like a dolphin
Baby, I'm a king, I'm a god, a thug
My verses will live if I die from slugs
That shit is power, man, that shit is love
No, you cannot buy that from no fuckin' plug


I'ma baptize niggas, let's get baptized
I'ma baptize niggas, let's get baptized
'Bout to baptize niggas, let's get baptized 
I'ma baptize niggas, let's get baptized


Look, she said it's cold inside that water, made her nipples hard
That's that liquor talkin', sippin' Gin and readin' the book of Genesis
Just before in the beginnin' and shit, pride lies, deceit
Blah-blah, sinnin' and shit, Adam and Eve dumb ass, apple eatin' thumb-ass
Hit the gas and hit the gas
At the Saks Fifth, with a religious sack to grab gifts
How you get money and act as if poverty's past tense?
We see bad shit happens, but what happens to bad shit?
You need your ass whipped
Friendship, missionary, Beulah Hill Baptist
Norfolk County doin' peyotes from a cactus 
Alabaster flows, out in Cali with some Calabasas hoes
Hella bad, put your ass up on my nose
With a sack of bud, I'm just a sack of bones
Sacrificial Lamborghini, do the dash up on the road
Throw a stone like David, I got that Tom Brady arm
And a navy gun, case the joint
Case and point the pistol at yo' neighbor
Look at yo' neighbor and say "Neighbor," uh
Stack up all yo' paper, uh
Pray for me, I say a prayer for you, be not forsaken, uh
Jump in a lake, uh, let the water run over yo' face
We baptize people, now they breathtakin'
Nigga, wait, I'm 'bout to


Baptize niggas, let's get baptized
I'ma baptize niggas, let's get baptized
'Bout to baptize niggas, let's get baptized
I'ma baptize niggas, let's get
I dare one of you punk motherfuckas 


Made in his image  I even work in mysterious ways
See, I've been over my lyrical phase, I rather be potent
Burnin' that bush like Moses, hood on my back like Cobras
Eat the forbidden fruit, girl, it's a lot more I can show ya
Kickin' that simple shit like Yoda, let y'all think it over
Fresh out the fire, Abednego, officer pull you over 
Killin' a nigga in cold blood, get him a Christmas bonus
Wasn't until it went digital that you finally start takin' notice
Now you wanna be delivered, huh? Guess who pullin' up to dinner, huh?
Got me center-court like a Tyson punch for a million bucks
Is it worth what you really givin' up?
Got my heart broke by a Taurus
Went and found a Gemini with a bigger butt
And only God can judge, and that's only if He still give a fuck
Water to wine, it started out fine but now it taste a little bitter, huh?
Lotta these guys just live in disguise, I'm shinin' the light, the jig is up
Everybody know Jesus hang with the hoes, killers and the criminals
Gon 'head, tilt your head back, hold your breath for the ritual


Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh Lord, oh Lord


Water, please fall down on me, me, me 
Water, please fall down on me, me, me, me
Fall down on me
In the name of the fire, the water, the skies, and the earth
Thou shall live or die, thou shall bless or curse
Go forth into forever
Down, down
Hey Hallelujah, hey Hallelujah
Praise the Lord





Yes


And we smoke so much that we canât get high 
We cried five times, butâweâhad a goodâtime
Hot damn, Iâm the man crippedâup in a poncho
I got so fucked up in Toronto
I sewed my eyes closed like a blind fold
Ice cold, green tea, whoa, Uncle Iroh


I went stupid on a wrist
I look candid in my pics
Who that talkinâ all that shit?
I want him to meet my fist
We donât play that little bitch 
You sorbet like counterfeit
Iâm just gettinâ off this fit
Tobi gettinâ kinda thick
They donât know me, they not hip
They could blow me, suck a dick 
They donât know that I wonât quit
They donât know Iâm too legit
And my phone on two perceâ
I think me and you should dip
I wish you could take a hint
Youâre the one I wanna miss


I-I-I- I went stupid on the wrist 
I went ugly on the rack 
Yeah I pulled up in the front 
Sitting pretty in the back 
Who that bangin in the whip? 
Your bestfriend said, âwhat is that?â 
Now she sanginâ all my shit 
My shit different when it hit 
Now who still think they shit donât stank?
Ainât nobody ask you what you think
Two white cups and I got that drank
It could be purple, it could be pink
Iâm just a big ass kid
I had a dream and I took that risk
Man yâall really canât tell me shit 
When I pull up they say, âitâs that bishâ


Itâs that nigga, young six figure
I won like seven, that shit hit different
Iâm high as heaven, I just went missing
I need two seconds, the room keep spinninâ


And we smoke so much that we canât get high 
We cried five times, but we had a good time
Gotdamn, Iâm the man cripped up in a poncho
I got so fucked up in Toronto
I sewed my eyes closed like a blind fold
Ice cold, green tea, whoa, Uncle Iroh


Do she really love me?
How should I know?
She threw it back like a quarterback spiral
I caught it clean, sideline, like a tight rope 
I wanna see how you look with my eyes closed 
I save money like I just switched to Geico
This not Off-White, bitch itâs albino
Iâm so blessed, bitch I look like a Bible
Iâm so stressed, you would think I had finals


And we smoke so much that we canât get high 
We cried five times but we had a good time 
I-I-
Smoke smoke smoke





Hey

It's been a while since I had time for me

Mais' Margiela with the polo

Nights like this, I wish I was wit' you 
On my turf, roll out, the 
ShÐµ like when I hit the receiver
Friend hop in, this is a four seater
Made it yank, straight out the wood, I'm Derek Jeter
Major leaguer
No Fatigue, uh
We don't get no handout, we don't get no Macarenas
Baby gon' throw your back out tryna work, you need a breather
I need a break


Won't you get down with me, down with me, down with me?
Don't put me down, put me down, put me down, put me
Won't you get down with me, down with me, down with me?
Don't put me down, down with me, hold on, uh
Won't you get down with me, down with me, down with me?
Ooh, you down with me, down with me, down with me
Ooh, you down with me, down with me, down with me
Ooh, you down


Hmm, hmm, hmm
Tell me who you talkin' to?
Roll up that Sinatra, fly lil' mama to the moon
She ask me what's my life path?
Told her, fifty-five south to DeKalb
So many couches I crash
Shout out Zaza, Dre-Dre, and shout Classick
Baby, I know you really wanna be my only one
But I need me somebody to hold on 'til the sun come up 
Baby I know you really wanna be my only one
But I need me somebody to hold on 'til the sun come up 
Baby, I know you really wanna be my only one
But I need me somebody to hold on 'til the sun come up 
Baby, I know you really wanna be my only one
But I need me somebody to hold on 'til the sun come up 


Still

Whoa





A nigga really done fucked up now
Lemme catch my breath, finna hold my breath
Yo Power, this a really great beat, good job


Get it and go, stack up my dough
Bitch eat my dick like a meatball hero
Black on my body like Neo
I been had the sauce, I'm the new TapatÃ­o
The fuck is a T.O.? Terrell Owens
Fuckin' bitches barely knowin' them
Sometimes I feel suicidal
Shout out to my nigga $crim
Bang, no Chiddy, run it up like Giddy
Better not fuck with me, Zeltron 6 Billi'
Got the rock like Milly, get cent like 50 
Better not talk shit when I got goons with me
I got the power , but I'm not a Ranger 
Got the beat by Powers  and we just made a banger


Get it and go, I'll stomp your ass to the ground
If you think you can fuck with my flow
Open the door, I do not walk through that muh'fucker
If they not talkin' no dough
I don't smoke dro, I barely drink
Pour up that coffee for niggas that sleep
Used to sell quarter of ounces of stink
I make a quarter a show if you blink
You couldn't see what I saw, now you peep
Now they on D, I hit the flea flicker
You should've seen quicker, I'ma just Ether him
I'ma just Ether him, make 'em see heater, son
I'm a say I'm the dad, niggas from Trinidad
Come with that choppa' that don't need no helipad
Hit your ass, pop pop, and now you irrelevant
Pop up the trunk and I don't mean an elephant
I'm talkin' stacks, you talkin' bricks
All of the rhymes you rap ain't legit
I catch a case, I plead the fifth
You catch a case, you bring the clique
I'm not the type to lose sleep for a bitch
I might just fuck for a week then I quit
I might just cop me a Rollie that don't lose the value
And trade in the shit for a crib


Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro


Bitch, I don't got no respect for opposition
Casket and it don't show with dirty feelings
Blood on my blunt, you get the picture
Blaze carry blades with tetanus, so don't get shot
Y'all think your Majin gettin' booed off stage
Writing books like me, you ain't on my page
Grey 5-9 apes, we sell waves
Bitch, you won't act tough with a gun in yo' face
I pull up with a red light, nigga, what's up?
Nigga tryna peel off like, "Oh shit, fuck"
When the buckshots spray, better duck or have luck
All my dogs got fed when the moon comes up
Wit' a pit bull off its leash
It's the Wardog boss, real shit
They never break, they form, stay a milli'
When the clip go off, what's up?


Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro
He shoot his shot and I bet he gon', bet he gon'


I just jumped back like I'm on one
Look what you did, bitch, you owe us somethin'
I'm just the guy, like just get it done
Smokin' gelato, got plenty sons
You like Juwanna Mann, I like designer fame
Tats on my chest, rep' the Zombies man
All on that bitch like a sonogram
I be that nigga, that Hall of Fame
Look at yourself, we are not the same
High as a pit like I'm on a plane
Fuckin' that bitch like they all the same
Ain't nun' with Juice
I'm drunk off the booze with a thou' on the shoes
I just won't lose, niggas is fool, swag
I'm rockin' the blue fur
I like that bitch right there, think I'm gon' like, her


Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone
Get it and go, your bitch is a hoe
She sent me a flick when I flick on my phone

Yeah, uh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Watch me get gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Amerikkkan Idol, one hand on my bible, one hand on my rifle
I'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival
They say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals
So I came to kill the game and still gave it revival
I'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel
Last nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial
I'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel
Now she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial
While I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now
I wanna be down but she denounced
I got my shot, then made her, bounce
Now you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now
While the future figure me out
Told mommy pick a place, yo, and we out
'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now
That's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around
Never thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down
Protect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town
And they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown
And for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground
And have the nerve to blame it all on my background
Sorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out
Got a message for the world and I won't back out
So turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out
Watch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House
But I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black
And we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack
Media's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact
Feedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs
Assimilate our history then made it a mystery
Now they all inherit the bittersweet victory
Look at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?
Justice never served, reparations never sent to me
It's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me
Assassinate my character, buryin' my entity
But they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done
They forever gon' remember me
The fuck is you tellin' me?
Fuck is you tellin' me?
Way more than a celebrity
And fuck white supremacy, huh


I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me
Well, dead presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me


It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas goin' off


This that Bada$$-assination
Topic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation
Been makin' observations like it's my occupation
Debatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature
Thou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you
'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up
Climb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though
Devisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke


You leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
Yeah yeah yeah
I said leave me no choice, about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice


What the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil
Disturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain
With all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike
They are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world
The scary part, boys and girls
Is most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement
And accomplishment of what we call human rights
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it
Because this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'
They're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off
Usin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough
There are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want
We have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane
But to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us
The people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally
It's time to even the score
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other
The code words to killin' a black man by police is, "He's got a gun"
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs
Or what about them? Them murderers got it
We need solutions, you better start plottin' now
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives
My people been sufferin' way too long
And I'm tired of singin' the same old song
People actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that
What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard
Ameri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon
And eventually, we'll all be doomed
Real, real, real soon





Parrish Blue
Yeah, yeah
Ooh
I can't feel my face 'cause it's too pretty
Lift your fingers at me if you with me, hmm


I can't touch my face, too pretty 
Put a finger up if you really fuck with me 
Yeah, 'member those, on a truck
Lotta things I don't trust
You like one of us, hmm, yeah

Yeah, 'member thosÐµ, on a truck
Lotta things I don't trust
You like one of us 
Run in, giddy up 
WhÐµn you see me in the clutch, yeah 
Please don't interrupt
When you see me in a clutch 
Please don't interrupt


I can't feel my face, cause it's too pretty 
They too trigger happy in my city 
Miss me very badly, when you hit me 
Lift your fingers at me if you with me 

I can't touch my face, too pretty 
Put a finger up if you really fuck with me 
Yeah, 'member those, on a truck 


Lotta things I don't trust 
You like one of us, ooh 
Run in, giddy up 
Ooh, oh


If you ever feelin' down 
You know I could pick you up 
Some like a city bus 
Heads up, seven up 
24/7 us 
I ain't never lettin' up 
That's against whoever up
Next time, boys better luck 
Next time, if there is one 
Shit, might be the last one
But ain't this better than the last one?
Hmm 
Pretty much 


I can't touch my face, too pretty 
Put a finger up if you really fuck with me 





Life sucks and I never tried suicide
Mind's fucked even more than I realize
Time's up, keep it moving when she arrives
If you ever heard what I heard in my mind
Never try, you would cry, that's a lie, you would die
I don't wanna ever come down from a high
I'm in the best seat, from time, been a next breed
If you comin', come at me directly
Don't need no one to defend me
Soul's in a place even I can't get to, don't fuck with the deadly
Moon waves and open seas, quick coasting over seas
Fuck those who don't believe
They will never wanna admit I'm the best here
From the mere fact that I've got ovaries
It's a woman's world, so to speak
Pussy, you sour
Never givin' credit where it's due 'cause you don't like pussy in power
Venom
Venom


My, my, if you've ever heard what I've heard in the night
What a fright, must've been a parasite in my past life
I don't wanna ever come down from a high
My soul ascended to the sky, it's just you and I
God but I'm feelin' too alive
Tryna get me out of spite
Someone's gotta pay, I ain't talkin' big amounts
Some kind of physical pain
Some kind of traumatic shit
Niggas wanna see dead bodies
Probably not, they ain't rollin'
With no automatic clips
Moving scatty, all erratic and shit
Niggas pussy lickin', batty and shit
Oh, you mad? Then come at me, you prick
Make a move, better pattern it quick
I assume you'll be comin' for blood
That makes two of us, that makes two of us

Night time to daylight we roll trees
Saved lives, invade minds and go deep
Oh, he wouldn't have guessed I'm so chill
Part of the day in the life you won't see
Part of the day in the life you can't be here for
It's the day in the life of OG's
Dealin' with inner demons that won't leave
Not a word, you will listen when my soul speaks
Down I go, so follow me, follow me, follow me
Actually, don't follow me, nobody bother me
I'm a mess, honestly, fuck all of your policies
They wanna kick me down and demolish me
Use me and fuckin' abolish me
I don't wanna hear no apologies
Or am I in my own head?
Can't tell anymore, psychotic to the death
When I dig deep, I can never find nothin' left
It's a mystery
Rage, nothin' but rage
Can't figure out if I'm goin' insane
Ain't no doubt we'll be showing no mercy
So think twice if you wanna get blazed
Nothin' ain't nice 'round here, no games
I don't wanna dark nobody in a flash
True, it's a stick-up, hands in the air
Put the money in the bag, all cash, all cash

Ice on my neck , flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check 
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest 
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex 
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed 
Two-tone Patek 
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets 
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put an M in my bag , gon' get used to these racks 
I went to school where they teach you finesse 
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest 
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk 
Know the coupe fast when it end with an S



Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in ten, but I got there in four


I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control 
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothin' but five minutes, she hopped in it and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm

La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color, and I got CC's you ain't seen yet

Thirty pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet

At a Clippers game on the courtside 
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five 
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger"

Tia and Tamera in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid 
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some
Girl, say some, no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house, all she needed was some

Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around
When you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a mÃ©nage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...


All she needed was some 
All she needed was some 
All she needed was some 
All she needed was some 
All she needed was some 
All she needed was some 


Oh gosh, oh my God 
Oh my God 
Know tonight, our neighbors 
Are all alone, no no, no no no no no 





Ooh, oh, oh


I met a man playin' in the woods
His piano was off-key
He sang to me softly
I bet he wouldn't change it if he could
Gunshots ringin' in my hood
They sound so off-beat
I'm prayin' they don't off me
I promise I'd change it if I could


Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 

Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 


I retreat to the trees, surrounded by green, but I need
Need more for my kin and more for my team 
Dance to a different type beat, off kilted rhythm
Took the traces of my feet, but I need more
Before I dip out of the scene
For my niggas, for my queens, for the babies, for my rounds
For my sisters missin' crowns, homies victims to apathy, like
Honey drippin' off the table in front of me, ah
They say, "Go," but my heart still fights for the seed
They buy shows, but my soul shouldn't back the deed
Oh, why? Oh, why? Why, why, why?
So, you get rich, I'ma try to get free, but
Not exclusive, mutually, but
Oh, I, oh, I gotta find the balance between


Some say, "Life is just a Hell
And it's here we dwell until we're truly, truly, truly free"
Some say, "Projects and ghettos and seeds that will never grow
All berries to see"
I'll stay with you through the night and in the darkest times
We'll fight through it all until we reach that dawn
I dream of a world where love is the rule
Where hearts walk two by two
And I with you
I dream of a place where a child's wish can always come true
And the old and withered become renewed


I met a man playin' in the woods
His piano was off-key
He sang to me softly
I bet he wouldn't change it if he could
Gunshots ringin' in my hood
They sound so off-beat
I'm prayin' they don't off me
I promise I'd change it if I could


Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 

Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 
Oh, why? 


I can see the ripple, I can see the changes, oh, my
I can feel the reaper, I can hear the angels, oh, I
Cross my heart for safety, hope I stay alive, oh, Lord
They always go too crazy, it's really peace of mind, good God
All my life, I had to fight, all my life, passin' by
All my life, I had to write, all my life, I had to die
All I had to sacrifice, blood, sweat, and tears pays the price
Start to think the better day's tomorrow, keep my spirits high up
When it rains, it pours, my ceiling go up
Then it turn in my floor, then the gang show love
Then count my blessings, my praise goes up
Big dawg, my nigga since day one
When the Sun go down, when the lights go up
Still ten toes down, I'ma keep mine tucked
I'ma bang my buck, I'ma play my hand
Then I ain't gon' change 'til I free my lands
I'ma use my hands, I'ma play my songs
I'ma play mine right 'til I prove my dance
And the key to my life, I'ma sing my wrongs
I'ma be that light, I'ma clap my hands
I'ma smoke my weed, see my bands
And I lead by faith, and I play my jam
And you might think I'm out of tune
But it ain't got shit to do you with you, oh my, God


Your freedom is beyond anyone outside of yourself's controllin'
It can't be bought and sold, given away, or even stolen
It's a divine entitlement, vital to the nourishment of the soul
Encouragin' spiritual growth to channel the ethereal flow of creation's river across the cosmos
This blessed osmosis, triggerin' consciousness to focus
And the paradigm ascension, transcendin' beyond all space and time dimensions
Not to mention my penchant for benediction
Been addicted minds, been consistent in my grind
Of usin' every pen and pencil I can find
To elevate the state of decline, that's draggin' my people down so deep that the climb could never be done in a single lifetime
So I write life's lines, correction, my lines write life
Correction, my life lines right up
When serving' my purpose to write and recite what touches
And sights ignite that unites us
So we can finally stop runnin', from freedom
Yeah





Sangria and bottle tops
Popping like we'll never stop
Reaching for some H2O
Let's wash away these boulderârocks
Dropâa penny inâthe ocean
Start a chain reaction
Euphoric butâunbalanced
Like two top heavy fractions
Cannon fodder, tunnel vision
Cocoa butter television
Silky smooth paranoia influencing my decisions
Jostling for position
We're so shit at making plans
I miss your naked body and I miss your clammy hands
I'll always show you up when I'm with you
Trouble holding my liquor
Passing out in your kitchen 
It's always 5 AM when you call me
Different day, same story
Hang it up and ignore me


I fucking hate it when you leave
'Cause youâve got something that I need
And I'm not zen enough to do this each week
Girl, I fucking hate it when you leave
'Cause you've got something that I need
And I keep dosing myself up on repeat, yeah


Yeah, our satisfaction is not by accident
Photographing our lifestyle
Our attraction is almost passable
I'll write your name on my profile
Happiness induced chemically
But you tend to me until I pass out
Here's the link to my Soundcloud
Here's the keys to my hometown
Mi casa es tu casa
Turn it up on the master
Brace myself for disaster 
You're always talkin' 'bout some home truths
Catching me in some foul moods
Eating all of my soul food


I fucking hate it when you leave
'Cause you've got something that I need
And I'm not zen enough to do this each week
Boy, I fucking hate it when you leave
'Cause you've got something that I need
And I keep dosing myself up on repeat


Remember when you brought me marigolds and wine
I put your shirt on then we kissed to pass the time
I miss the places you would take me when we got too high
But won't you stay at mine just for a little while?


I fucking hate it when you leave
'Cause you've got something that I need
And I'm not zen enough to do this each week
Girl, I fucking hate it when you leave
'Cause you've got something that I need
And I keep dosing myself up on repeat





Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh


This for my niggas on the east side, yeah
Thisâforâmy niggas onâthe west side, yeah
This for myâniggas on the north side, yeah
This for my niggas on the south side, yeah


I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky


Oh, yeah, you and, you and I, you is superfly
Cutie pie, I knew you was high, I don't usually try
Usually I kick it with my girls  use your guide
Ma ma se, ma ma ma coo sa, you should stay inside
Late at night, admire how you stick with the weed
And you mind, don't you go out tryin' to think
Out of all the trees smoked would get you higher than me
Took a toke and you spoke, now you inspirin' me 


I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky


Get me so high, I'm like, "Damn, you fly"
Ever say, "Let's go kiss the sky"
Would you come and shift all the tides?
You should, it's a crazy world that's blazing outside
You're my haven, I'm your lady lover
Hit me when you turn on my street
Don't be shy now 'cause I know I got what you need
Out of all the trees you smoke, what get you high like I do?
Dick chokin', and I spoke, I lit the spark up in you


I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God 
I get up, I get up, I get up so high 
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high 
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky


Lift her up, I could lift her up, be my little bum
Sniff her up, you get high as fuck in my mama truck
Lift her up, I could lift her up, be my little bum
Sniff her up, you get high as fuck in my mama truck
Lift her up, lift her-, lift her up
Be my little-, lift her up
Lift her-, lift her up
Be my little-


Hoes in the pew
It was a long weekend, but we made it, amen, amen
To my bishops and my bishopnesses
To my deacons and my deaconnesses
And my trustees and my trustesses
The usher boy and them other boys, shout out Pharrell 
The nurse ministry 
To the children's choir
We love you with the love of the Lord 





 I pray for my family
I pray about money, I pray about money 
I pray about peace
I pray it's all peace, I pray about peace
I pray itâs all love
I pray about love, I pray about love
While smokin' my weed
While smokin' my weed 


While smokin'  big gas inside this motherfucker, dawg
Please ash then pass when you don't then I'm appalled
Let this spliff bang to the Heaven, through the halls
From your bathroom stalls, we drop shit like sloths too
I'm 'bout to shake her loose, I got the Jigsaw saw too
Local beef at the barbecue that your momma threw
A few shots flew but it's cool 'causÐµ he only caught two
News at 12, channel 1-1 but tÐµn minutes later we heard the drum
But the band, they ainât playinâ, 'cause it was Sunday
I pray for better days, maybe Iâll make it to Monday
If you get up out my way
Let me look into the sun, 'cause I don't got no occupation
You can say I came from nothin' but I found my destination
On the daily empty stomach, they say, "I should take a break"
But they canât break me off no money so it's always just a phase
And the days continue comin'
You see what I'm made of, you see if I'm able, you see what I pray for


I pray for my family
I pray about money, I pray about money 
I pray about peace
I pray it's all peace, I pray about peace
I pray it's all love
I pray about love, I pray about love
While smokin' my weed
While smokin' my weed 


Ayy
This one for the people in my corner, yo, we finna own a buildin' 
And stand on the corner , with our children 
Teachin' them the angles, so they no stranger
To the shape of a million, shinin' cause we are brilliant 
Cut diamonds
Chillin' on the fingers of the women we chose as they mommas
And don't make me kill for 'em, you could judge if you want
But I'll ride for mine, your honor
And leave it to the hand of the designer 
She wear the Gucci to the trial 'cause we good
And the devil always brandishing the Prada 
She gon' take the stand to stand with me in silence
Judge throw a sent' and she gon' be a comma
See her face and I be calmer
I see her waist and I see what time was 
That's why I can't let an hour pass, without thinkin' on time we had
So when I get a minute I acknowledge that, facts


I pray for my family
I pray about money, I pray about money 
I pray about peace
I pray it's all peace, I pray about peace
I pray it's all love
I pray about love, I pray about love
While smokin' my weed
While smokin' my weed 



Surprised you picked up, I know you've been dealin' with the world and all his little hiccups
I don't mean to bother you, well yeah, I kinda do
See we've been wrestlin' with this nasty plague, that's kinda like the flu
I ain't a doctor, I don't know, but I know rich folks dyin' too
And I know they gon' get their treatment first, when that shit gets approved, and that's some BS
You should've seen the panic on your kids' faces
In the grocery line clutchin' tissue up to our breast
If it's the end of days, end of times, then here's my last request, I pray for power
To strike these cowards down and send 'em straight to You, that
Fear disappears and love brings again, clear and truth and peace
And healin' for all my past relationships with women
I ain't perfect, go ask Satan, sometimes angels do the sinnin'
Pray my enemies and frenemies, stay up out my way
Unless they wanna see the pavement, I pray they don't have to pay
And I pray that all my sins wash away, okay


I pray for my family
I pray about money, I pray about money 
I pray about peace
I pray it's all peace, I pray about peace
I pray it's all love
I pray about love, I pray about love
While smokin' my weed
While smokin' my weed

Crash land, hop out the whip, did the flag plant
One giant leap, hit the moonwalk, you ain't MJ 'til your shoes drop
You ain't 2Pac 'til you shoot cops
Just another black man, every day a episode of Boondocks
And it's really nothin' you can do about it
Play a throwback on the juke box
Oh shit, '06, O-J, Guwop
Got me in the mood now
Hit it out the ballpark, different kind of heartthrob
Aubrey tried to tell me, "It's a Rollie, not a stopwatch"
When you from the bottom, every shot a long shot
So don't try to tell me that it matter what I call God, I don't get that
Y'all be lookin' big mad, lying up in here, this hoe like Sinbad
Stick it to my side like Tip hat, you ain't strapped, baby, get that

Take me high, don't take me low
You know we got a really long way to go
I gotta thank God for the Sun above
'Cause my Black skin can't shake the cold
Unlock your doors, open up your soul
You ain't gotta be so Minnesota
They love me in Cologne, I ain't talkin' 'bout the odor
I love it when I'm home, on my sin, on my soldier 
I'm demanded, now I met a man alone standin'
Holdin' a sign in his hand it read "stranded"
I took a chance and pull some money out my pants
And said, "Sorry, it's not much, it's what I have"
He laughed, said, "It's love when you do what you can
When you don't have to, I got a mother and dad
They don't even care where I'm at, nigga, thank you"
Brother, go buy you a gun and rob a bank

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more, no more, no more,ânoâmore
Hit the road,âJack, and don't you come backâno more, ooh, ooh
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more, ooh, ooh


My baby, my baby
Why you treat me so cold?
You put me out on the side of the road
I had my own thing going way before you came along
Now it's 3:45 in the morn', and I've been up callin' your phone



Spill drinks on my clothes
She throwin' hands 'bout some hoes in my DMs, tryna be low
I gotta go, I got goals, I got shows, for sure
They out sold, I don't sell my soul
My soul sails, no parasails
My paragraphs jail, well life real
Life, know real, I persevere from out the lion grill
To my defense, you just offended 'cause you ride the bench
I'm sidin' with God, ridin' with y'all got me in problems
Findin' my flaws, I feel a force, I'm, built for it, fortified
It ain't 1954, I ain't your nigga, boy
One hand Glock, John Hancock
Want a signature?
Send the coordinates, drop a pin, I'm feelin' immature
Centaurs rumblin' through the forest, check your temperature


Fuck niggas, bitch
You cryâwhen I'mâbrighten your day
You cry-cryâwhen I'mâbrighten your day
You cryâwhen I'mâbrighten your day



We're always fighting 
You always leave 
Mentally drowning 
Eventually 
Her mind's on money 
My mind's on green 
Yeah, you're enticing 
Yes indeed 


Runnin' through the maze like lab rat
Or an Indian in the field with a hazmat
Runnin' away from small pox, packin' like backpacks
Stack up your Andrew Jacks, 'til you come back like clap backs
No cap, no capitalist, billionnaire back tax
No black Batman, countin' Benjamin Afflecks
But once you get that money they gon' say you don't act black
I said I might be lightskin, bitch, but I'm matte black
I know many moochers like Cab
They like to use us like movers in Ubers and cabs
Uncle Sam is the one that really could use a hijab
It's hard to face it when you used to usin' ghostfaces
I could hardly blame my people for confusin' bags
You should brag, I refuse to beg
I'm a howling wolf, pull up in that chess records who's your dad? 
I know my freedom papers ain't my payment stubs
But how could you blame a nigga just for chasin' tubs


We're always fighting 
You always leave 
Mentally drowning 
Eventually 
Her mind's on money 
My mind's on green 
Yeah, you're enticing 
Yes indeed 







I generally vent from the ventricle
Trust a aorta to dispense what is sensible
In a world where the truth is unmentionable
I tip-toe with my tap shoes, my black views are not identical
Not very welcome, like Van Helsing at the Vatican
Kicking that rap again
Blurting out that I'm African
And, so are some of you
But you'd rather cup your ears and sing Xanadu
I guess to challenge the world could damage you
And really rip through the flesh like a cannibal
Wipe that slate clean, proceed to daydream
Wipe that slate clean, proceed to daydream
Yes, the blue skies occasionally turn grey
Just re-calculate your age by your birthday
But we also love ourselves in the worst way
Man- and Woman-kind floored from the first day
Young World


Chapter 7
Young World


Young World, Young World, before you say "hey, let's hold up"
Spreadsheets and see the way things fold up
It's been a minute, yes indeed, so you're older
Is there a big, fat chip on your shoulder?
Take care before it becomes a boulder
An avalanche, an aroma
That can leave you stuck in a coma
Many lessons, many teachers in life
Some of us never graduate with that diploma
Or, even make it to the next phase
We celebrate days and weeks and months and years
Should we celebrate sweat and a bunch of tears
In a world where you're rubber-stamped worthless
From the beginning
Got to go and find your purpose
Nobody's grinning
The winner never seems nervous
Life is not just a moment, it's a skillful opponent
That you have to fight or learn to justâ¦roll with







Doctor told me I should rest
But I ain't gon' never ever quit
I like girls withâprettyâfeet, yeah
And jeansâthat'll never ever fit, yeah, yeah,âyeah


Top down 
And I'm floatin' through the city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out 
Deputy out to get me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Top down 
And I'm floatin' through the city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out 
Deputy out to get me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Most that shit y'all talkin' bout
Ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin' 
Say you 25 when you really 32
Baby goin' in, go and stop frontin' 
Bottle in the club cost a stack
You ain't even got nine hundred 
Ben-10 with the bustdown
Different ring got my whole damn leg
Got my whole damn leg
I dare you, put it together
On that white just like Othello
I don't check emails, better be textin'
CC me if you're talking reckless
Pinky toe yellow, foot on the pedal
My bitch a speed devil
That's vroom, vroom, vroom, skrrt
They won't catch us never
BeyoncÃ©, my halo
My angel, my devil
My shooters come through with the doot, doot, doot, doot
Man, I'm tellin' you
I got the heart of a dragon
I'm livin' like I imagined
World is mine, no askin'
The world is mine, I'm stabbin', stabbin' now


Top down 
And I'm floatin' through the city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out 
Deputy out to get me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Top down 
And I'm floatin' through the city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out 
Deputy out to get me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I don't waste time on the phone like that
And I stay leavin' texts on read
I had, the minute I'm home, I ran into a fling
But I can't really call her my ex
She said, "I see you, I know you been workin', lil' daddy
You look like you gettin' to the check
I know you focused on work
But I can't help but notice you can't talk about nothin' else
What about you?
How's your mental? How do you cope with what you been through?
How's your tempo?
Who in your life are you really close to?"
I was like, "Damn," space left blank
Plenty of fish in the sea, but nobody fuck with a shark in the tank
Peddle my mind later, washin' the whip
See my reflection, it's all in the paint
Laid back top, bumping that Frank Ocean, "Crack Rock"
When I pull up, ridin' with a pack rat, don't get caught
Been through it all, I'm no stranger to loss
R.I.P. Richard, Olivia, Charles
If nothin' else, I'ma do it for y'all
I don't rap, I just say what's on my heart


Top down 
And I'm floatin' through the city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out 
Deputy out to get me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Top down 
And I'm floatin' through the city, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch out 
Deputy out to get me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Said I've been drinkin'
And I've been smokin'
And shawty, I'm flying' down 285, but I'm so focused
Said I've been drinkin'
And I've been smokin'
And baby, I'm flying' down 285, but I'm so focused





Here and now, I'ma say it real loud
It's a new day, 'notha spin gone 'round
Lookâaround,âwe alive rightânow
Stackin' up big love 'til it'sâover


Carpe diem, make love get the creum
Now or never, primeâtimeâlikeâDeion
I'm the lion,âI can smellâif you're frightened
Big love linkin' up like a hyphen
We don't deal with that fear 'round here, no
Free to laugh, free to cry, let your tears flow
At your best, be yourself with your people
Get high, we don't care if it's legal


I see the beauty in the little things
Hear the music when the wind blows
Turn these moments into memories
Don't overthink it, keep it simple
Spread love like a miracle


Here and now, I'ma say it real loud
It's a new day, 'notha spin gone 'round
Look around, we alive right now 
Stackin' up big love 'til it's over
Get down if you wanna get down
It's a new day, 'notha spin gone 'round
Here for now, we alive right now
Stackin' up big love 'til it's over


Love is patient, love is kind, love is sweet
Love is hatred, love is mine to the top, let's get wasted
Through the night, start a fire in her heart
Just a spark, let 'em know who we are
I'm a lion in the dark, baby, I will never part from you
Million miles away, I am never far from you
Outta thin air, baby, I'll be there
Come and test me, I'll show you who I be


Had to run it back twice 'cause the vibes was right
Go on a mission, give and you get it
Makin' it run until it's done
Baby, keep on livin', love will change your life
Open it up, feelin' the love
Feelin' the love, feelin' the love


Here and now, I'ma say it real loud
It's a new day, 'notha spin gone 'round
Look around, we alive right now 
Stackin' up big love 'til it's over
Get down if you wanna get down
It's a new day, 'notha spin gone 'round
Here for now, we alive right now
Stackin' up big love 'til it's over


We be stackin' up love
We be stackin' up love, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Stackin' up big love 'til it's over
We be stackin' up love
We be stackin' up love, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Stackin' up big love 'til it's over





What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch
A real-ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? 
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?  
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch  
A real-ass bitch, bitch 


I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like


My niggas taking over
BROCKHAMPTON, call your momma
My niggas goin' platinum
Break necks, send you to the doctor


Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection, mm
Did me wrong like a perfect stepson, mm
Been a wrong, you can change the song, hon


Who got me riled up?
Who the lame-ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me
Ugh, ugh, ugh, come get it from me


Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters


When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy


They be like, "What the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the fader when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top-shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that zoom if you just assume


I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like


MERLYN!





Yo, whassup? This is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope 
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometime,s it gets a little hectic out there

But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill


Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration


I get inspired by the blunts too! 
I'll front you , if you hang with a bunk crew 
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this 
I need not explain this 
A-Plus is famous, so get the Amos


Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look greatâlet's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre 
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her


Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, âcause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til


Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chillâ¦ from 93 'til


Huh, my black Timbs do me well 
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell 
Another person's busy-ness, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch


Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
They hit blunts and flip once
I'm chillin', âcause my crew's close, kid


I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, âcause I'm an exception to the rule 
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee
Blam leakin' out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid


Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, âcause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 to infinityâkill all that wack shit!


Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til 
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til 


I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit
With my own clique, roll many backroads
With a fat stog' and blunts, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'
Niggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh, and â¦


Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid 
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some ill fits, some new kicks
I often do this, âcause it's the pits not being dipped


Flipped! The flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The ex...traordinary, dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her


I mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! 
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass 
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see, from now 'til infinity


Ahhh , this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Huh! This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah! This is how we chill from 93 'til
Aww, yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til


Haha! Just coolin' out, y'know what I'm sayin'?
But, but who's chillin' around the land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, Plus
Casualâyou know he's chillin'
Yo, Pep Loveâhe gotta be chillin'
Jay-Bizâyou know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, myâmy man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike Gâyou know he's here chillin'
Yeah, my man Mike Pâyou know he gotta chill
Del the Funky Homosapien is chillin'
Aye, aye, my man Dominoâyo, he's chillin'
Yeahâ¦& it's like that, yeah
Yeah, ill
I could do that
You know what I'm saying? Peace





Back back, way back, I used to fret that my honey
Would play me for one with more papes, still it was funny
Cause she paid no mind as jerks lurked constantly
And my insecurity turned into maturity 
As the years pass I find it hard to be monogamous
So do other brothers, so the scene's still synonymous
Catch crazy glares when I'm with female company
Some think I'm a softie and they step to her in front of me
So in public places I am often found in my trunk
Reaching for bats, and smack goes his spunk
Because I have the right to riff, and in spite
Of a few protests, progress and I might smite you
Once you come, your fronts, they got no future
Blunts blur my sight, get left and right suture
I know this, and also notice advances:
I peeped them papers in which he slipped to my dip
With numerals, and you're soon to roast thinking I'm jelly
Cause numbers left in the gutter lead to lonely tellies 

Cause we see who's pee-wee and we see who's me
The difference is Vaseline: You're slipping while I'm skin-dipping
Grips, and grips of chumps my way:
Slumped from back-bumps on rumps, cause I flay
So why play, cause Tajai has to flip
I found mine, so find your own companionship


Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy. Why is that?


Brothers get jealous when I'm chilling with my dip
Just because she's flyer, you try to, play me like Milton Bradley
I'm mad, G, just because you've gotta settle for Maggie
Or Agnes, maybe Mathilda the Witch, yo
I'mma have to beat you if you call her a bitch, yo
Keep your mind off what's mine for the keeping 
Or I'll put a bomb in your house while you're sleeping 
Keep your distance, Hiero is watching you

Step by step, I never slept, I gots to do lots
Cause you brothers never respect who you should 
Try to be my friend, and it might do you good 
Get down with the program, hey yo man yo
Don't even look at my girl on a slow jam
Of course not, you'll never get that close 
To her soft skin, rest in a coffin
If you ever disrespect, I'll twist your neck
If I've got a bat, I might get pissed and flex 
Cause your tramp ain't got a stamp of approval
When I get mine with this rhyme, your crew will
Have to learn the hard way, I'll have to slam you like Hammer
So I bet you'll all break
Even though his song is wack, mine's not
Your girl will never get the props that mine got


Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy. Why is that?


I'm the brother stepping with the flyer female companion
Others be scheming or scamming, dreaming, planning, plotting
Trying to make moves when I'm not in the vicinity
I'll fill that ass with splinters, see
Pull a wood bat, would that change your disposition?
Wishing you was in my position, kissing and hugging on a goddess
But I stay humble and modest
Brothers want to rumble, but they stumble and fumble
Cause they get pummelled by the mischievous
You might catch a whiff of this sneaker
Seek the company of my sweet senorita?
Swing a bat like The Natural, break your clavicle
Fracture femurs, as you scream I'm overcome with laughter
I'm the champion, my man slaps me ten
Cause he's twice as nice, twice the jealousy
Cause fellas see they don't suffice
Opio Lindsey spins the spinal cords
Of the hordes of the Huckleberry Finns
My knuckles are buried in chins
Cause it offends when you're stepping
Adrenalin is pumping, I thump chumps with my weapon
Moments of tranquility abruptly have to cease
Walking hand in hand, when one feels he has to speak his peace
Should I pull a piece and unleash a couple of bullets?
Would it persuade a brother to turn his head and foot it
In the opposite direction, throat sets in his chin
Recognized that I fooled him


Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy. Why is that?
Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
Everytime she sees you
She could just take off
And you could just let off steam by screaming
No, no, nooo

When the night goes, where do I go?
I live my life with my eyes closed, with my eyes closed
I'm just a boy, ah, oh
I'm just a boy, ah, oh


I go outside and the sun doesn't shine
There is thunder in my steps, make the dead come back to life
There's static in the air
Which one of y'all go try to shake me off my step?
There's an oculus in the sky


I run from evil
I run from people
I run from evil
I run from people
I


WhÐµn the night goes, wherÐµ do I go?

I been looking for an out, I got burns on my couch
Mota make it bounce, make it dribble, make it
I can not account for the red in my account
Got em down for the count, I'm out for blood I'm like the Count
Look me in my eyes so you know I live it
World so frigid, we just hit the single digits
Don't snake, don't switch, don't pivot
When I'm finished with it, imma have my own exhibit
Car trouble, still whip it like it's from Xzibit
Used to want the fame until I seen what came with it
Used to pop a pill but now I'm popping canned spinach
Tired of tryna keep explaining when you can't get it

Cause I can't hate myself, unless I ain't myself

I been looking for a O
Let me check in my account
Checks on checks you could look at my neck
And can tell my advance is not gon' bounce
If the clock still count gotta make that count
But I just can't keep my count
Wickedly ways and wicked amounts
I just ate a dish that I can't pronounce
Being broke was the title, and I just broke that cycle
So when a nigga ball go psycho, damn a nigga just like Michael
Shoot my range on rifle
Shot my shot that's light but I
Don't know why she sit so high though
I'll knock a bitch off of the Eiffel
My success so vital
Verse on verse it's straight from the Bible
Genocide I don't know why though
They just waiting on my arrival
Used to pop a pill but now I'm popping
Bad bitch DM hopping
Coliseum stocking



Cause I can't hate myself, unless I ain't myself
And when I ain't myself, it's hard to tell
Cause I can't hate myself, unless I ain't myself
And when I ain't myself, it's hard to tell




I could get a kill-shot running
But you might not love it
Run to the cops no telling
But your heads still buzzing
Running in and out give me five
When I pull up no one else has arrived
Flicking on the tv when you cry
We could chain my heals to your dirt bike

Drive over son and make him fuck your brains out
Fuck your brains out

So
Running down the pieces in the sand
Wondering if youâre ever getting back
Wondering if theyâre ever getting home
Home
So go
How you making love if youâre her dad
Nothings evÐµr been here in the sand
Now Iâm gÐµtting higher than the band

Played with your food for the last 3 summers
Kicked off the roof tryna aim like gunners
Popped off a few on the hillside
Coughed up a rock in my throat so hard
Throwing up blood all over the yard
Running round shooting my guns, yeah Iâm over paid

Fuck it girl you canât be fucking saved
Now he fucking knows about it

I could get a kill-shot running
But you might not love it
Run to the cops no telling
But your heads still buzzing

Drive over son and make him fuck your brains out
Fuck your brains out





I wanna rock right now
I brought my whole alliance and we all Bronx-bound
Drunk up off the cisco with the figaro and links
Countin all the moolah and the diamante sphinx
Dragging on the reefer's got my soul high for weeks
I think i see 5 put the mag under the seats
We living like it's dynasty with custom-made juice
 blaze is empty i need to get loose


Watches into the lil underworld
Put sugar walls in naked cities under sniper's moon
The house of bamboo is shining love acupuncture
Menage a trois the french connection is the satin prince
Watch the re moment and taste up in seventh heaven
On cloud 9 contact minnesota fats
Let em dream let em dream
Of the satin city
When of the wine those moonshiners fine as hollywood
How we do how we do


Coast with me in the vicar
Bubblin
Six figures on ice
Bubblin
Erryday type bidness
Bubblin
Diamond cork franchise
Bubblin


The high from sonny cheeba
Connect with the Sheba baby shan
The snatch gold and free c'est la vie
Midnight sun melting ice grills of the face
Mr frost they close with the slaves of new york


Tiffany conniption
Persist and clutch extension
Connive and blade heiress underseas tension
Cut close with toast
Cherish pearl tongues
Arabian nights designing dreams for the young


Way out with the satin struthers
And erryday's hollywood on my satin dogs
They was with dr. feelgood in my seduction palace
On king size Ethan Allen
Comin better cheat
Inside my nutcracker suite


First notice black lotus
Blow this with friction
Currency exchange multiple digital diction
Remote control corners, digested sugar
Praise be the Lo-ah for love we gon' live it




Love for the cot
It's hot sugar live on the block
A flight to the jungletown plot
They shine a light put the jizm up in the flow
My air tight sugar flow and slick lo enough
I'm on a blockbust with the jungle game prayed
And shakedown from the main squeeze erryday
Put notes on the bricks with the razor out dice
And check it out why yo get out black 


And now we live that pop life, tequila sunrise
Mo Don visions, China doves cry
Reflect off the ocean, Graceland moves
Pacific height action, the firestar crew
Vanilla trench apron, istol underneath
The ballantine believers, not when i sweep
The odyssey of lo-ah, boy it's to the sky
Brigante syndicate for the solar flight high
