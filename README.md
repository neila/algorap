Fully integrated machine MC+DJ in the making.

Use lyriccrawl.py to generate your text dataset by specifying a spotify playlist of your choice.

Use optimize_network.ipynb for network architecture optimization. The parameters will be used at next step, fed into spitfire.py.

The generated .txt file should then be fed into spitfire.py with the optimal settings, which creates fresh lyrics, algorithimically trained to optimize rhyme density.

(Currently, the process of picking the optimal model and applying it to the neural network is left for manual operation for customization purposes)
